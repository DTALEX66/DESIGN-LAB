-- DESIGN-LAB — the knowledge library's one mutable truth source, plus its derived index.
--
-- Two canonical tables and one derived one, and the split is the whole point of the design:
--
--   knowledge_entry           one row per entry identity (what a later entry may supersede);
--   knowledge_entry_revision  the entry's content, append-only, one row per revision. The
--                             revision's whole document is stored as canonical JSON so a reader
--                             can re-validate the bytes it serves, and "current" is
--                             MAX(revision) computed at read time -- there is no `active` flag,
--                             because a mutable current-marker is how a second truth source is
--                             born (the ACTIVE-version invariant this repository already holds);
--   knowledge_entry_fts       an FTS5 trigram index over the current revision's searchable
--                             fields. It is DERIVED: deleting every row here loses no fact, and
--                             src/design_lab/knowledge_library.py rebuilds it from the revision
--                             table. No trigger keeps it in sync on purpose -- a trigger would
--                             make the index a second writer, and the rebuild is the proof that
--                             the two can never disagree for long.
--
-- Trigram is chosen for CJK substring search, and it cannot match a query shorter than three
-- characters (measured on this host's SQLite: MATCH '分镜' answers zero rows). That is not a
-- comment to be trusted later -- design-lab/tests/test_knowledge_library.py asserts the short
-- query really does miss the index, so the LIKE fallback in the module has a failing control
-- rather than an assumption.
--
-- Append-only is enforced here, not by convention: UPDATE and DELETE on either canonical table
-- raise ABORT. A correction is a new revision, and a superseded entry keeps every revision it
-- ever had (DL-KB-02 acceptance A4: the same source at different versions is retained).
