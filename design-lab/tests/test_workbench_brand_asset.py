"""The brand mark in the stylesheet is the tracked vector, and nothing else.

The Workbench carries the owner's logo as an SVG data URI inside `style.css` rather than as
an asset route, because src/design_lab/workbench.py serves a fixed three-path allowlist
under `img-src data:`. That makes the shipped stylesheet hold bytes that no editor
should be trusted to keep in sync with the asset they came from, so the sync is checked
here -- through design-lab/scripts/render_brand_asset.py's own `--check`, which is the
single owner of the predicate (this module imports it rather than re-deriving it).

The asset changed shape mid-round: a 144x144 PNG cut-out produced by a brightness-threshold
pipeline was replaced by the owner's vector, and this module was not re-run then, so four of
its cases went red on the first exact-SHA cloud run after the switch (design-lab/tests/
test_workbench_brand_asset.py was not in the 76-gate rollup, which is why "aggregate green"
never exercised it). They now grade the vector: the encoded payload, its path count, its
single brand ink per encoding, its viewBox identity with the tracked file, and the digest the
provenance record claims.

What each case is for:
  * the tree passes `--check`, and the ways it can rot (payload swapped, digest claim
    swapped, asset file absent) each make it fail -- a check that cannot be disturbed
    guards nothing;
  * exactly one region exists, inside `:root`, and every named consumer uses the token;
  * the mark is a two-path glyph drawn in one ink, identical between its two encodings;
  * the mechanism that forces inlining is still the mechanism: if an asset route is ever
    added, this test says so instead of the data URI quietly surviving on its own;
  * the positioning line is one claim across three surfaces -- the authority states it, the
    served landing page repeats it twice, the rail splits it at a seam -- and they must agree.
