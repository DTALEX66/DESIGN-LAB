"""No verification script may be orphaned without a recorded reason.

`canonical-verify.yml` enumerates its gates one step per script -- there is no glob and no
manifest -- so a `verify_*.py` that nobody adds a step for never runs, and nothing anywhere
says so. That is how `scripts/audit_workbench_ui.py` came to report twelve live Workbench
violations (including a 23px-tall sole mobile navigation control) while every required CI
context was green.

This test is the anti-recurrence gate: the set of unreachable verifiers must equal the
explicit exemption list below, in both directions. A new orphan fails, and so does an
exemption that has gone stale -- either because the script was wired in, or because it was
deleted while its excuse stayed behind.

    `test_every_orphaned_gate_is_exempted_with_a_reason` asks whether a *script* is named by CI.
    It cannot see the mode: `deepseek_hermes_migration.py --verify` was reachable by name (its own
    module-level constants are imported elsewhere) while its read-only form had been printing FAIL
    in both trees for weeks, unheard, because no table ever passed the flag. This test asks the
    mode question, and it answers it from the same source set the reachability walk uses.

    Measured 2026-10-09 in both the primary tree and a clean detached worktree at 5f3e5d1d
    (porcelain 0 before and after): the ten rows below are declared with the verdict each printed.
    Four forms that were green in both trees and read tracked text only got wired into
    `verify_projection_freshness.py` as RECEIPT_CHECKS in the same commit, so this register holds
    only what cannot yet be required -- which is what makes it shrinkable.

    The first version of this predicate looked for a name and a flag within three lines of each
    other and matched the exemption tables themselves -- eight declared rows lit up as "invoked"
    because a docstring two lines away said `--check`. Reading the tables as objects replaced that.
    Its helper was then named `test_module_calls`, which unittest collected as a test case and ran
    with no arguments: a `TypeError: missing 1 required positional argument`, i.e. a helper whose
    name makes it a test. It is `call_sites_in` now, and the planted-call control says a prose
