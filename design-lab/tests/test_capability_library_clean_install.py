"""DL-FINAL-T05 — the capability library must work from an installed wheel.

What this card's acceptance actually claims: `/api/capabilities` and the declared core
journey are usable in a clean install, and the install test runs **outside** the repo CWD
with the source-tree fallback disabled. Before this module that claim was unmeasured: the
CI wheel job installed the wheel and launched the Workbench, but nothing ever called the
capability library from an installed layout, so a wheel that shipped without the four
resource files would still have passed every check that existed.

Three tests, each answering a different question:
  1. does the packaging declaration still list the four resources? (no toolchain needed,
     so it runs everywhere and catches a force-include edit immediately)
  2. does `build()` really read the packaged copies when the repository is out of reach?
     The probe runs in a subprocess whose CWD is a temp directory and whose `sys.path`
     points at an extracted wheel; the assertion is on the module path AND on
     `REPO_ROOT` not being the repository, because "it worked" is worthless if it worked
     by reading the checkout.
  3. does it fail closed when a packaged resource is missing? Without this, test 2 could
     pass through a silent fallback and we would not know which branch produced the data.
