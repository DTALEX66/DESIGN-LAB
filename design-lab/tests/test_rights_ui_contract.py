"""The RIGHTS surface may only say what the rights façade and its contract can say.

apps/workbench/tests/appshell.mjs block ⑧ proves the behaviour: one click files one
decision to the real POST route, a refusal replaces the previous verdict, an unread field
is drawn as 未读回, and the column reports the façade's own limits. Behaviour cannot see a
vocabulary, and text cannot see a click. This module checks the other half -- the claims the
page makes about the SERVICE -- against Python and against the contract file the store loads:

  * the clearance chip only colours words `rights_review.py` can emit, both ways;
  * the decision chip only colours the contract's own enum, and never the approving word,
    because the page decides "does this scope clear?" from the façade's `unapproved_scopes`;
  * the submitted document is exactly the contract's closed property set, so no field is
    dropped and none is smuggled in (`supersedes` is a query parameter, not a document
    field -- the store refuses it inside the document);
  * every field the page reads back is a key the façade actually publishes, and every row
    attribute is a contract property. An HTTP readback cannot carry `actor_kind` or
    `supersedes` at all, so a page that rendered them would be showing a claim this route
    never sent;
  * the route exists, is dispatched before the fall-through 404, and keeps
    `RightsReviewError` ahead of the generic ValueError clause so the refusal code and its
    detail reach the operator instead of collapsing into INVALID_REQUEST.

Every extraction asserts on the way. A pattern that matches nothing fails the gate rather
than passing on an empty set.
