"""The 证据系统 delivery column may only say what the receipt contract can say.

apps/workbench/tests/appshell.mjs block ⑦ proves the behaviour (a click, one request, the
document and its two refusals on screen). Text cannot see behaviour, but behaviour cannot
see a vocabulary either: nothing stops this column from colouring a third, greener axis,
branching on a code the route never answers with, or reading the jury list without
reporting its shape. Those are claims about the SERVICE, and the service is Python, so
they are checked against Python here -- the same way
test_artifact_preflight_ui_contract.py checks the preflight profiles.

Every extraction asserts on the way. A pattern that matches nothing fails the gate rather
than passing on an empty set.
