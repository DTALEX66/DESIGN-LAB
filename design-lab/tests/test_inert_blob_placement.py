"""DL-GOV-INERT: third-party agent-instruction blobs must stay out of active paths.

AGENTS.md requires upstream `AGENTS / CLAUDE / cursorrules / SKILL / install /
affiliate` text to be kept as inert source blobs that never enter root
instructions, prompt assembly, tool discovery, or capability counts. This repo
marks third-party provenance with a sibling `SOURCE.md`, so the precise,
machine-checkable violation surface is: a tracked `SKILL.md` sitting next to a
tracked `SOURCE.md` outside an inert root.

`huashu-design` lived at `packages/capabilities/production/huashu-design/` with
exactly that shape -- upstream trigger phrases ("触发词：做原型、PPT…") and
second-person instructions to whoever executes it -- while
`QUARANTINE_REGISTRY.json` already listed it as quarantined. The registration was
true and the bytes were not, which is what this test exists to prevent.

Scope this test does NOT claim: `integrations/hosts/open-design/expert-suite/skills/`
and `design-lab/skills/` hold `SKILL.md` files with no `SOURCE.md` sibling, so they
are not matched here. Whether the Open Design expert-suite skills are first-party or
vendored is a separate provenance determination this predicate cannot settle.
