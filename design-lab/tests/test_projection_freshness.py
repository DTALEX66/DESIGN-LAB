"""A projection that can be re-checked must agree with its own record -- on someone else's clone.

Two defects came out of building `verify_projection_freshness.py`. The first:
`deepseek_language_inventory.py --check` compared the committed per-language file counts against
the live tree, so it had been red for weeks while nothing ran it -- no workflow step, no aggregate
entry, no test, and no reachability pattern match. The second: three other read-only forms pass on
the machine that generated their record and report DRIFT in a clean checkout of the same commit, so
their green describes a disk rather than a repository. Those were named exclusions with reasons, not
dropped entries; one of them (RECOVERY-SAFETY) has since been fixed by archiving the receipts it
audits, and the two left are still named in `test_exclusions_are_named_with_a_reason_and_a_real_script`.

The falsification that matters here is the writer form: an entry invoked with no arguments is the
bug this gate exists to catch, so a test plants exactly that and requires the gate to refuse.
