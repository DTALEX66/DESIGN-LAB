"""Prove that every task ledger has a schema, and that it is the schema for its version.

The root cause this gate closes is a version string with no contract behind it: on
2026-09-09 the ledger moved from ``design-lab/task-ledger/r3-v1`` to
``design-lab/task-ledger/r5-v1`` and no r5-v1 schema file was ever written. The r3 schema
stayed in place, still correct for the r3 file it was written for -- the frozen predecessor
validates against it with zero errors -- while the live ledger lost its contract. Nothing
noticed, because nothing selected a schema by version: 105 schema errors reported against
the r3 file looked like ledger rot and were actually a missing pairing.

Four jobs, each a check and not a comment:

1. read the live ledger's own ``schemaVersion`` and resolve THAT to a schema file. An
   unresolvable version -- outside the table with no conventional file, or in the table but
   pointing at a file that has gone -- is a hard failure naming the exact path it looked for.
2. read the frozen r3 predecessor's own ``schemaVersion`` and resolve it too, so the
   predecessor keeps a job instead of being deleted as "stale" the next time somebody tidies
   ``design-lab/schemas/``.
3. check the pairing is honest: the selected schema's ``properties.schemaVersion.const`` must
   equal the version that selected it, and every ``task-ledger-*.schema.json`` on disk must
   be named by exactly one version. A file nobody selects is an unmaintained contract; a
   version nobody maps is this branch's defect.
4. make schema and data mutually accountable, the way this repo's other ledgers work (see
   ``verify_ledger_subject_binding.py``): a property present in the ledger and absent from the
   schema FAILS by path -- ``additionalProperties: false`` alone only says "not allowed", not
   which field -- and a property the schema declares that the live ledger never uses is
   reported: unsanctioned ones fail, and a sanction whose field the ledger has started using
   fails too, so the register cannot rot into a list of features nobody has.

What stays in Python because JSON Schema cannot say it: dependency acyclicity, the
task/receipt cross-references, equality of each task definition against the frozen taskpack,
and the derived ``required_axes``. That is ``src/design_lab/governance/r5_contract.py``, and
the schema says so in its own ``description`` instead of pretending with a weaker shape.

Read-only. No network. Deterministic given the two files.
