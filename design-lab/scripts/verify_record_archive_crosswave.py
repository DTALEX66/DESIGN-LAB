"""The cross-wave pointer register: which archived material two or more waves both claim, and where
its bytes actually are.

Why this exists instead of a merge that moves files: `docs/history/**` is frozen byte-for-byte by
`design-lab/config/task-document-states.json` (prefixRule, basis HISTORY-FREEZE-RULES), and six
archive manifests each declare their own member list. Four of those waves re-register material an
earlier wave already archived, so a reader who lands on the older row cannot tell whether the bytes
exist twice or whether they are looking at an alias of one canonical copy. Measured before writing
this: 340 distinct member digests across the six manifests, 48 of them claimed by more than one
wave. Deleting anything to "merge" the waves would rewrite frozen originals for 0.5 MiB; that is an
owner ruling, not an engineering gap. So this script writes the pointer layer only.

Every digest here is read from `git cat-file blob HEAD:<path>`, never from the worktree, because
`core.autocrlf=true` on this machine means a checked-out file is not the committed bytes -- a
register that hashed local files would state values no fresh clone reproduces (the same reason
scripts/generate_archive_record_register.py hashes blobs).
