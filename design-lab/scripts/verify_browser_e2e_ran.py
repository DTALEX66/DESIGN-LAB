"""Enforce the no-skip policy for the Workbench browser E2E on CI.

`test_workbench_design_layer_e2e.py` and `test_workbench_overflow_gate.py` are
PROBE-driven: when the toolchain (node + a resolvable `playwright` + a matching
Chromium) is present they drive the real browser against the live loopback
service; when it is absent they HONESTLY SKIP. On a clean GitHub runner nothing
is pre-installed, so a naive run would skip and be silently treated as a pass.

This gate makes that impossible in the dedicated `workbench-browser-e2e` CI
job: the job installs the pinned `playwright` (workspace dependency) and its
matching Chromium first, and this script REQUIRES every browser test to actually
RUN and PASS — a skip or failure in ANY module exits non-zero, turning the CI
job red.

Deterministic and stdlib-only (drives the existing unittest shell in-process).

# falsified against the pre-fix checkout before being wired in, so it can go red.
# `test_workbench_theme_geometry_gate` joined on 2026-10-11: it measures the nav rail's painted width
# per palette. The register is a tuple, not a glob, so an unlisted browser suite would skip forever
# without a finding -- and this comment said "Both" while three modules were already listed.
