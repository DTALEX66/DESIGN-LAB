"""DL-ROUTE-PAYLOAD-CONTRACTS: a bound route must answer with a payload that its schema accepts.

Why this gate exists. ``design-lab/config/contract-bindings.json`` recorded, as named debt,
that a set of routes answers with a payload carrying a ``schemaVersion`` for which NO schema
file exists anywhere -- ``design-lab/jury-readback/v1``, ``design-lab/task-resource-preflight/v1``,
``design-lab/path-diagnostic/v1``, ``design-lab/capability-library/v1`` and
``design-lab/domain-pack-readback/v1``. A version string with nothing behind it is the
artifact-preflight gap (commit 1ea64bbe) repeated five times: a reader sees
``schemaVersion`` and assumes a boundary is enforced.

Each debt has now been closed one way or the other, and this script is what keeps it closed.
Three more were paid here on 2026-10-20 -- GET /api/models, GET .../model-selection and GET
.../knowledge-candidates/<id>/export -- each added with the live payload that produced it, in the
same move as the schema and the ledger row, because a schema nobody feeds a real response to is a
reader-visible claim of enforcement.
It does not trust a ledger row that says BOUND_SCHEMA -- it drives the product over a real
socket and checks what came back:

1. PAYLOADS ARE THE PRODUCT'S. One ``design_lab.http_service.make_server`` boot against a
   scratch project root; every payload compared here is the bytes that route wrote,
   ``json.loads`` of the response body. Nothing in this file assembles an example. If the
   emitter's shape changes, what lands in the comparison is the changed shape.
2. THE SCHEMA IS A VALID draft 2020-12 document, and every real payload validates against it
   (SCHEMA_VIOLATION).
3. BOTH DIRECTIONS OF FIELD DISAGREEMENT ARE RED. A field the schema ``required`` that the
   route did not send is MISSING_FROM_EMITTER; a field the route sent that a closed schema
   does not declare is UNDECLARED_BY_SCHEMA. Nested locations are compared too, including
   map values (``tools.*``, ``current_verdicts.*``) and the branches of an ``anyOf``.
   ``$ref`` is followed into the document that owns the shape, so a jury record is compared
   against ``assurance-jury-record-v2.schema.json` rather than restated here.
4. THE VERSION IS ONE VALUE ON BOTH SIDES. The schema's ``schemaVersion`` const, the binding's
   declared version, and a literal the emitter source still produces or compares must agree
   (VERSION_DRIFT). This is the check a one-sided bump cannot pass.
5. THE LEDGER AND THIS FILE MUST AGREE, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. Every binding here must appear in
   ``contract-bindings.json`` as a BOUND_SCHEMA row naming the same schema, version and emitter
   file (LEDGER_DISAGREES); every BOUND_SCHEMA row naming one of these schemas must have a
   binding here (UNVALIDATED_BINDING). Deleting the row, or quietly downgrading it to
   SCHEMA_LESS with the ``version`` and ``emitter`` fields removed, is red here as well as in
   design-lab/scripts/verify_contract_bindings.py -- the debt line is not removable.
6. NOTHING TO COMPARE IS A FAILURE. Zero bindings, a binding whose files are missing, zero
   payloads, a payload that is not a mapping, or a schema that binds no object location the
   payload reaches are each red. A gate that matched nothing must not report a pass.

Usage:
    python design-lab/scripts/verify_route_payload_contracts.py
Exit 0 when every binding holds, 1 otherwise. The last line printed is
``VERIFY_ROUTE_PAYLOAD_CONTRACTS=PASS|FAIL ...``.
