"""DL-CLOUDAUDIT-H001: main-branch CI artifact proof gate (download readback).

FINAL TaskPack section H / H001:
  "main run #182 artifacts=0. 如要求 artifact proof，必须真实
   upload -> GitHub API query -> identity -> download/readback -> hash
   -> run/SHA binding."

State of the world this closes
------------------------------
The release layer already has the FULL real-readback chain, but only for tag
operations: ``release-gate.yml`` (tag-only, owner-gated, E5) drives
``design-lab/scripts/verify_release_preflight.py`` (identity -> CI run ->
download + sha256 -> release assets -> run/SHA binding).

What was missing is the *main-branch* side: the canonical verify run uploads
artifacts (``secret-history-report`` from the license-secret-gate;
``workbench-e2-<sha>`` from the browser-e2e job) but no step ever proved
those uploads actually reached GitHub, that the bytes come back identical,
and that they are bound to the exact run/SHA. H001 is that proof.

The four legs, against THIS run (``GITHUB_RUN_ID`` + ``GITHUB_SHA`` -- the
trusted default env vars every CI step receives, never attacker-controlled
event inputs)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. identity : query ``/actions/runs/{run_id}``; the run's ``head_sha`` must
              equal the expected subject SHA (run/SHA binding). If the
              identity leg fails, the artifact leg is not attempted at all --
              proving bytes against the wrong run is a contradiction, not a
              proof.
2. query    : ``/actions/runs/{run_id}/artifacts`` must list the artifact by name.
3. download : fetch the artifact archive and recompute sha256.
4. hash     : the recomputed digest must equal the digest GitHub's API
              reported for that artifact (``digest: "sha256:<hex>"``).

Boundary, stated honestly (never silently widened):
    step 4 compares two API-produced facts (the uploaded bytes' digest vs.
    GitHub's own digest of those same bytes) -- a download round-trip /
    availability proof on the main branch. It is NOT independent asset
    identity: the independent ``artifacts.sha256`` asset-set + checksum
    binding stays in the release layer (``release-gate.yml`` /
    ``verify_release_preflight.py``), where published release assets are
    checked against locally-known digests. H001 proves the upload -> readback
    leg on main; it does not re-implement the release leg.

Indexing lag, and why the gate paces a re-query
-----------------------------------------------
H001 runs as its own job *after* the two uploader jobs, i.e. seconds after
their ``upload-artifact``. GitHub's ``/artifacts`` list API indexes uploads
asynchronously, so a just-uploaded artifact is frequently not yet listed.
That lag is a real, recurring property of this exact timing (unlike the
tag-time release preflight, whose artifacts pre-exist the check). So the
gate paces ONE re-query of the still-incomplete artifacts after
``--retry-seconds`` (default 20s): the common lag resolves to PASS within a
single run instead of forcing a manual re-dispatch. A genuinely BLOCKED
artifact (a digest mismatch / missing download URL) is terminal and is never
re-queried.

Output contract
---------------
    CI_ARTIFACT_PROOF=<PASS|BLOCKED|INCOMPLETE> checks=N findings=[...]

- ``PASS``       (exit 0): run identity bound, every named artifact found in
             the run's artifact list (after at most one paced re-query),
             downloaded, and its recomputed sha256 matched the API-reported
             digest.
- ``BLOCKED``    (exit 2): a check ran and contradicted the claim (run not
             found / run/SHA mismatch / named artifact has no download URL /
             digest mismatch). BLOCKED is terminal -- the re-query is skipped.
- ``INCOMPLETE`` (exit 3): a check could not run (no token, API unreachable,
             not-JSON answer, or an artifact still not indexed even after the
             re-query). An unindexed artifact is NEVER a PASS.

Usage (from the non-required ``ci-artifact-proof`` job in canonical-verify):
    python design-lab/scripts/verify_ci_artifact_proof.py
        # defaults: GITHUB_REPOSITORY / GITHUB_RUN_ID / GITHUB_SHA,
        # artifacts "secret-history-report,workbench-e2-${GITHUB_SHA}"

All network access goes through ``verify_release_preflight.fetch`` (the
release layer's single injectable stdlib entry point) so the download
redirection policy (drop the token across hosts) is inherited, not
re-implemented. Unit tests inject a fake fetch and a fake sleep and never
open a socket or actually wait.
