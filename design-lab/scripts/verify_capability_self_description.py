"""DL-CAPABILITY-SELF-DESCRIPTION: the Workbench describes its own coverage; that text is a claim.

The Workbench carries two machine-readable statements about what the product can actually do:
``VIEW_NOT_OPEN`` (the copy a slot shows when it has no backend route -- "研究洞察页未开放：
当前服务没有研究结论的持久化路由") and ``CAPABILITY_REGISTRY`` (one row per capability with a
declared ``route`` and an ``implementationState`` of PLANNED / BLOCKED / IMPLEMENTED). They exist
because a task pack required that a blueprint page with no backend must not claim to be usable.

Nothing checked them against the service. On 2026-10-08 the store, the read-back façade and both
routes for persisted research findings landed, and both statements stayed exactly as they were:
the research slot still told the operator that no route persisted conclusions, and the registry
row still said PLANNED. A stale self-description is not a cosmetic bug -- it is the product
advertising a capability gap it no longer has, which is the same false-green shape inverted, and
it is the reason a reader cannot trust the table that is supposed to tell them what to trust.

What it enforces, per refusal code:

1. ``CAPABILITY_CLAIM_STALE`` -- a view that declares itself unbacked must not have a route the
   service dispatches for it. The linkage is structural: a route's terminal literal path segment
   names the resource it serves (``/api/projects/([0-9a-f]{32})/research`` -> ``research``), and
   a segment that is not plain literal text (it carries a group, a class or a query) is skipped
   rather than guessed at. The same rule runs on registry rows: a PLANNED or BLOCKED row whose
   declared route is dispatched is a claim that has already been paid off.
2. ``CAPABILITY_ROUTE_ABSENT`` -- the mirror. A row that says IMPLEMENTED must name a route the
   service really dispatches, with its `{id}`-style placeholders matched segment by segment.
   Without this direction the table could be repaired by simply typing IMPLEMENTED.
3. ``NOT_OPEN_COPY_VAGUE`` -- "not open yet" must name the missing route, because a slot that is
   empty for a reason the reader can check is a disclosure and a slot that is empty for no stated
   reason is a dead link.
4. ``ROUTE_READER_BROKEN`` / ``NOTHING_TO_COMPARE`` -- zero dispatched routes, zero registry rows,
   zero terminal segments or an unreadable route reader is red. A comparison that examined nothing
   must not report a pass.

The route list comes from ``verify_contract_bindings.route_tokens``, the AST reader the boundary
ledger already uses, so this gate and that ledger cannot come to different answers about what the
service dispatches. It reads ``shell.ts``, the source, not the built bundle: the bundle is a
derived artefact and the claim lives in the source.
