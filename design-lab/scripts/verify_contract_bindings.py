"""DL-CONTRACT-BINDINGS: every declared contract is either honoured or named as inert.

Why this gate exists. ``design-lab/schemas/contracts/`` holds 32 JSON Schemas and NONE of
them is read at runtime: ``grep -rn "schemas/contracts" src/`` returns nothing, and the
apparent hits in ``src/design_lab/`` are prose or version literals belonging to a different
document (``interop/delivery_receipt.py`` loads the ROOT-level
``interop-delivery-receipt-v2.schema.json``, not ``contracts/delivery-receipt.schema.json``).
Enforcement was a synthetic-fixture test (``tests/test_contract_schema_integrity.py``) that
invents its own instances, so the directory read as coverage while the product answered a
different vocabulary. "Declared but unread" is the same false-green shape as a vocabulary
nobody emits: a reader sees a schema and assumes a boundary is enforced.

This gate does not pretend the directory is real. It records, per schema, whether a place in
``src/`` produces or consumes that exact shape, and it re-checks that claim on every run --
so a BINDING cannot rot into fiction and an INERT row cannot be laundered into "future work".

What it enforces:

1. COVERAGE -- every file in ``design-lab/schemas/contracts/`` has exactly one row in
   ``design-lab/config/contract-bindings.json``. A new schema with no row is red
   (UNLISTED_SCHEMA); a listed schema that vanished is red (SCHEMA_ROW_ABSENT); two rows for
   one file is red (DUPLICATE_SCHEMA_ROW).
2. BINDING TEETH -- a row may say BINDING only if it names ``path:line`` producers/consumers
   in ``src/`` that still exist AND still contain the declared version string
   (BINDING_ROTTEN). The row's version must equal the schema's ``schemaVersion`` const
   (VERSION_DRIFT), so a one-sided bump is a finding, not an orphaned document.
3. INERT HONESTY -- an INERT row must carry a reason, must name no instance
   (INERT_ROW_HAS_INSTANCE: the schema is live, reclassify it), and must not phrase the truth
   as pending work (INERT_REASON_EVASIVE).
4. BOUNDARY COVERAGE -- every route ``src/design_lab/http_service.py`` dispatches on must
   have exactly one ledger row. Each row names its handler symbol, which must still appear in
   ``http_service.py`` (ROUTE_HANDLER_MISSING), and is either BOUND_SCHEMA -- a schema file
   that exists, carries the version string, and an emitter in ``src/`` that still produces
   that version -- or SCHEMA_LESS with a reason that says why nothing validates it. This is
   the check that would have caught the artifact-preflight gap (commit 1ea64bbe: a payload
   claiming ``design-lab/artifact-preflight/v1`` with no schema behind it).
5. STALE IN EITHER DIRECTION -- a SCHEMA_LESS row whose payload declares a version for which
   a schema now exists is red (SCHEMA_LESS_STALE): the ledger describes a debt someone has
   already paid.
6. NOTHING TO COMPARE IS A FAILURE. Zero schema files, zero ledger rows, zero routes found,
   zero route rows, or zero BOUND_SCHEMA route rows are each red. A gate that matched nothing
   must not report a pass.
7. THE VERSION COMES FROM THE CODE, NOT FROM THE ROW. A row that names an emitter is held
   against what that file actually writes as a ``schemaVersion`` VALUE (parsed from the AST, so
   a docstring that quotes a version is not an emission and ``{'schemaVersion': SCHEMA_VERSION}``
   resolved through the module's own assignment is). If the file emits versions and the row's
   version is not one of them, that is EMITTER_VERSION_DISAGREES; if the row drops the version
   field while its emitter still writes one, that is SCHEMA_LESS_DEBT_UNNAMED. This is the check
   that stops a debt row being laundered into an unremarkable one by deleting the ``version``
   line -- and it is why a paid-off debt is flipped to BOUND_SCHEMA here and re-validated against
   a real response by design-lab/scripts/verify_route_payload_contracts.py, rather than quietly
   stopped being mentioned.

Usage:
    python design-lab/scripts/verify_contract_bindings.py [--list-routes]
Exit 0 when the ledger is true, 1 otherwise. The last line printed is
``VERIFY_CONTRACT_BINDINGS=PASS|FAIL ...``.
