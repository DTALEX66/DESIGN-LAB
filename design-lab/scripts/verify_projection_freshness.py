"""Every tracked projection that can be re-checked must agree with its own record, on a clone.

Why this gate exists. Each generator that writes a tracked projection also has a read-only
``--check`` form, and nothing ran all of them together. Two defects came out of that in
2026-10-09: ``deepseek_language_inventory.py --check`` compared the committed per-language file
counts against the live tree, so it had been red for weeks and nobody saw it (no workflow step, no
aggregate entry, no test, and its name matches no reachability pattern -- a permanently failing gate
that is also an orphan), and three further checks pass on the machine that generated their record
and fail on a clean checkout, which means their green proves nothing about the repository.

So this gate runs each entry's own read-only form and reports the verdict lines, and the entry list
is exactly the set measured to pass in **both** trees. All three of those machine-dependent checks
have been fixed and moved into ENTRIES: RECOVERY-SAFETY by archiving its destructive-operation
receipts from their single tracked copy in the preserved evidence bundle so the verdict reads versioned bytes
instead of this machine's gitignored ``.project-local``; DEEPSEEK-FINAL-TEST-GATE by judging the
record against versioned test files and its own rows instead of re-deriving runs from a gitignored
bound-test history; and SPILL-CENSUS by judging the record against the path rules, git and its own
arithmetic while reporting the live census as machine state. EXCLUDED is therefore empty and is
kept as a named register rather than deleted: it is the place an unverifiable projection has to go
and say why, and ``test_projection_freshness.py`` pins that it holds nothing. (Dated correction: the
first version of this docstring said "four excluded entries" while the table held three -- a number
written from a remembered list rather than from the bytes, which is the same class of defect the
gate exists to catch.)

Read-only by construction: only the ``--check``/``--self-test`` argv appears in ENTRIES, and
``test_projection_freshness.py`` refuses an entry whose argument list is empty (that is the writer
form -- the defect fixed one commit before this gate existed).

    it), and a git error is now a finding rather than an empty snapshot.
