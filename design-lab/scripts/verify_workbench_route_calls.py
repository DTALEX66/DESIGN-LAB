"""DL-ROUTE-CALLS: the Workbench's API calls and the service's route table must agree.

Why this gate exists. ``verify_contract_bindings.py`` proves the service's dispatched routes
and the boundary ledger are the same set, and ``verify_route_payload_contracts.py`` proves the
payloads those routes write validate. Neither asks the question a page actually depends on:
does the TypeScript that runs in the browser call a path the service still serves? A renamed
route could keep every backend gate green -- ledger row, payload schema, HTTP test updated
together -- while the view kept fetching the old path and showing its error state.

What it enforces, in both directions:

1. FRONTEND CALLS ARE SERVED. Every ``api(...)`` / ``apiOrEmpty(...)`` / ``fetch(...)`` call
   in ``apps/workbench/*.ts`` that constructs an ``/api`` path -- from a string, a template
   literal, or ``'/api' + <const>`` -- must match a ``Route`` in
   ``src/design_lab/http_service.py`` ROUTES with the same HTTP method. ``api(path)`` is GET;
   ``api(path, body)`` is POST (the transport decides by the presence of a body);
   ``apiOrEmpty`` and ``fetch`` are GET. Template holes are tried against the id vocabularies
   the routes themselves declare (32/64 hex, brief-/direction-/img-/job-/native-..., design
   system names, the print/digital/video profiles), so a shape is compared, not a spelling.
2. BACKEND ROUTES ARE REACHED OR NAMED. Every ROUTES entry is either matched by a frontend
   call of the same method or listed in ``BACKEND_ONLY`` with a reason. The reasons are
   claims about the product: a route nobody can reach from the desktop UI is a deliberate
   surface, not an oversight, and saying so is what keeps the table honest.
3. EXEMPTIONS GO STALE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. A BACKEND_ONLY entry whose route vanished is red
   (STALE_BACKEND_ONLY), and so is one whose route the frontend now calls (the exemption is
   no longer true). A dynamic fetch allowlist entry that no longer appears in the sources is
   red for the same reason.
4. NOTHING TO COMPARE IS A FAILURE. Zero routes, zero call sites, or a call-expression
   grammar that finds nothing is red; a gate that matched nothing must not report a pass.
5. THE SPECIAL ROUTES ARE EXPLICIT. ``/api/local-session`` is served before authentication
   and is deliberately not part of ROUTES; the page routes are browser navigations with no
   TypeScript call site. Both are declared here with reasons rather than silently ignored.

Scope: TypeScript product sources under ``apps/workbench/``. Tests and the built bundle are
not the product's call sites and are excluded.

Usage:
    python design-lab/scripts/verify_workbench_route_calls.py [--list]
Exit 0 when the two populations agree, 1 otherwise. The last line printed is
``VERIFY_WORKBENCH_ROUTE_CALLS=PASS|FAIL ...``.
