"""DL-CLOUDAUDIT-B4 / G-4: adapter & integration machine-location locator audit.

Audit R10. Adapter / integration *runtime* source must not hard-code a machine
location (a drive-rooted executable such as ``D:\\Programs\\Open Design\\Open
Design.exe``, a specific drive, an install dir, a registry key) in a way that
assumes the owner's machine. The correct locator pattern is env-var / registry /
PATH-first with a fail-closed fallback.

This gate is *structural only*, per the task: it records the **locator refactor
inventory** (``design-lab/config/adapter-locator-inventory.json``) and enforces
it as a fail-closed drift guard. It does NOT refactor the code — that is the
owner-gated / TaskPack work this inventory hands off.

Model (mirrors the P1-3 library-index guard: stdlib, read-only, fail-closed,
``TAG=PASS/FAIL``):

  1. scan a fixed, versioned scope of adapter/integration files with a fixed set
     of high-signal machine-location patterns (drive-rooted paths/exe, env-var
     home reads, ``expanduser``, ProgID/CLSID/Program Files). The scope and the
     patterns live in code, so neither can silently drift;
  2. fingerprint every real-code hit (file + kind + normalised fragment);
  3. load the inventory and enforce:
       * every live ``violation``/``guard``/``locator`` hit is triaged in the
         inventory (a new untriaged hard-coded location fails the gate);
       * every inventory entry pinned ``true`` is still live (a refactored-away
         assumption must be re-triaged, not silently drop);
       * the inventory is schema-valid.

Informational hits (comment / error-message prose mentioning a path) are not
forced into the inventory: they carry no runtime assumption.
