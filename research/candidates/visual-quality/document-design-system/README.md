**A design system for documents.** Six skills over one token contract — analytical reports, diagrams, charts, decks, long-form specs, and brand theming — producing self-contained HTML that needs no JavaScript to read, no build step to open, and prints properly.

Most document tooling is welded to one output format or one client's brand. This is the discipline itself: what to measure, when a chart earns its place, how to structure an argument, and one shared set of semantic tokens underneath so a report, the diagram inside it, and the deck derived from it all look like one system.

```
/plugin marketplace add Avinava/document-design-system
/plugin install document-design-system@document-design-system
```

Then `/plugin` to confirm it is installed, or just ask for a report — the skills trigger on their own.

The repetition on the second line is not a typo. `@` reads as "from": it names a *plugin*
and the *catalog* it came from, and this repository publishes its own catalog containing
this one plugin, so both halves are the same word. The catalog is named after the
repository deliberately — marketplace names are global per user, so two repositories
publishing catalogs under a shared name would silently replace one another and orphan the
plugins installed from the loser. A per-repository name is unique by construction and
cannot collide that way.

<details>
<summary>Or install it as plain skills, without the plugin system</summary>

The skills read `core/` and run `scripts/`, both of which live at the repo root — so the
repo has to stay intact. Clone it, then link the skills you want:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avinava/document-design-system ~/src/dds
mkdir -p .claude/skills
ln -s ~/src/dds/skills/analytical-document-design .claude/skills/
ln -s ~/src/dds/skills/diagram-design            .claude/skills/
# …and so on, or link all six:
# for d in ~/src/dds/skills/*/; do ln -s "$d" .claude/skills/; done
```

Symlinks rather than copies, so `core/` and `scripts/` still resolve. Copying the skill
directories on their own leaves every `core/tokens.md` reference dangling and every
script invocation pointing at nothing.

## What it produces

Every image below is a committed example in [`examples/`](examples/), rebuilt from source by `python scripts/build_examples.py` and captured by `python scripts/shoot_examples.py`. Nothing is a mockup.

### Four voices, one contract

Identical markup in all four panels — only `data-theme` differs. Surfaces, ink, accent, typography, border character, and the methodology treatment all follow from the token contract.

  <img alt="The same content block rendered under editorial-coral, executive-navy, field-notes, and console-violet" src="docs/screenshots/themes-light.png">
</picture>

| Theme | For | |
|---|---|---|
| `editorial-coral` | General analytical reports, portfolio reviews | light · default |
| `executive-navy` | Board, finance, governance | light |
| `field-notes` | Research, audit, operational review | light |
| `console-violet` | Engineering readouts, ops reviews, incident write-ups | **dark** |
| `brand-template` | Your own brand — copy, fill every TODO, rename | — |

<sub>This image follows your GitHub theme. [source](examples/themes-light.html)</sub>

### Analytical report — evidence-led, reconciled, printable

Metric semantics, named denominators, a limit ledger, and a methodology block. The one that refuses to call a snapshot cohort "growth".

[![Analytical report](docs/screenshots/analytical-report.png)](examples/inventory-report.html)

Further down the same document — cohort columns and an attribution table that flags which "owners" are actually deployment accounts:

<sub>`analytical-document-design` · theme `editorial-coral` · [source](examples/inventory-report.html) · prints to 3 A4 pages</sub>

### Long-form document — RFCs, design docs, ADRs, specs, postmortems

Measure held at 62–72 characters, explicit status banner, a change log for reviewers, and non-goals given their own box because it is the section most often skipped and most often needed.

[![Long-form RFC](docs/screenshots/longform-rfc.png)](examples/platform-rfc.html)

<sub>`longform-document-design` · theme `field-notes` · [source](examples/platform-rfc.html)</sub>

### Deck — 16:9 slides that export one-per-page to PDF

Type scales with the slide via container queries, so an authored slide and a projected slide agree. No JavaScript: a deck that renders blank without JS is not a deliverable.

| | |
|---|---|
| [![Deck metric slide](docs/screenshots/deck-metric.png)](examples/capacity-deck.html) | [![Deck chart slide](docs/screenshots/deck-chart.png)](examples/capacity-deck.html) |
| Up to three numbers, one accent between them, and the same measure drawn once underneath | Charts render at `full-width`, not the document size — a doc-inline chart on a slide shrinks its own labels to nothing |

[![Deck section divider](docs/screenshots/deck-divider.png)](examples/capacity-deck.html)

<sub>`presentation-design` · theme `executive-navy` · [source](examples/capacity-deck.html) · 7 slides → 7 PDF pages</sub>

### Figures — diagrams and charts on one token set

Six forms, one accent, all resolving against the document's tokens at view time. This image follows your GitHub theme — and both renderings use the **same SVG files**, which is the clearest proof the token indirection works.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/screenshots/gallery-dark.png">
  <img alt="Figure gallery: architecture diagram, sequence diagram, ranked bars, columns, line chart, and a limit ledger" src="docs/screenshots/gallery-light.png">
</picture>

<sub>`diagram-design` + `chart-design` · rendered in `editorial-coral` and `console-violet` — the same SVG files, no re-render · [source](examples/gallery-light.html)</sub>

| Figure | Path | Why that path |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | Hand-authored SVG | Position carries coupling — auto-layout would assert relationships nobody intended |
| Sequence | Mermaid → prerendered SVG | Order is dictated by the protocol, so auto-layout is honest |
| Ranked bars | Observable Plot → SVG | Sorted descending, zero baseline, one focal bar |
| Columns | Observable Plot → SVG | Chronological, never sorted by value |
| Line | Observable Plot → SVG | Straight segments; a spline invents readings between points |
| Limit ledger | Hand-authored SVG | A linear track beats a gauge — same value, stated precisely |

### Brand theming — a guide in, a theme out

Point it at a brand guide PDF, a website, a screenshot, or a few hex values. It extracts with provenance, maps to the semantic roles, and audits the result — because brand colors are chosen for logos, and routinely fail contrast for body text.

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_site_theme.py https://example.com   # computed styles, not pixels
python3 scripts/audit_theme.py core/themes/acme.css         # every pair, exact thresholds
```

The auditor is the part that matters. Building it immediately found two defects in this repo's own default theme: `--accent-ink` on `--accent` was **3.12:1**, failing AA, and the accent sat 13° from `--warning`. Both are fixed.

## The one idea

> **Everything renders to an SVG string at authoring time. The only thing still live in the shipped HTML is CSS custom properties.**

That single rule is what makes the rest cohere. Diagrams, charts, decks, and reports share one token set, retheme with zero JavaScript, survive print, and stay one file.

It also settles the perennial Mermaid question. Mermaid is a fine *notation* and a poor *output format* — its default rendering brings its own fonts, colors, and spacing, none of which know about the document they land in. So Mermaid is an input: prerendered through [`beautiful-mermaid`](https://github.com/lukilabs/beautiful-mermaid) into an SVG whose colors are `var(--…)` references.

Open any example and change one attribute:

```html
<html lang="en" data-theme="editorial-coral">   →   data-theme="executive-navy"
```

The page, the chart's focal bar, and the diagram's arrowheads all move together. Nothing re-renders and no JavaScript runs.

## The skills

| Skill | Owns | Does **not** own |
|---|---|---|
| **analytical-document-design** | Evidence models, control totals, metric semantics, cohort/time semantics, classification confidence, report architecture, methodology | Prose-first docs, slides, standalone charts |
| **diagram-design** | When a diagram earns its place, form routing, layout/edge/label rules, Mermaid→SVG prerender, hand-SVG for concept diagrams | Quantitative charts, UI mockups, editable `.drawio` |
| **chart-design** | Chart-type selection, axis honesty, encoding rules, palettes derived from tokens, grayscale survival | Narrative structure, dashboards-as-applications |
| **presentation-design** | 16:9 HTML slides, one-idea-per-slide, slide hierarchy, PDF export | Documents meant to be read rather than presented |
| **longform-document-design** | RFCs, design docs, ADRs, specs, postmortems, runbooks; prose hierarchy, cross-references, footnotes | Metric-led reports |
| **brand-theme-design** | Turning a brand into a theme — extraction from a guide, site, or screenshot; mapping to semantic roles; contrast auditing | Picking between themes that already ship; restyling one document |

Each `SKILL.md` is a lean index — 110 to 181 lines — with the depth in `references/` loading only when relevant.

## Layout

```
core/            the shared design system — the single source of truth
  tokens.md        the semantic token contract
  themes/          editorial-coral · executive-navy · field-notes · console-violet · brand-template
  base.css         component→token mapping (contains no color literals)
  print.css        print as a distinct output mode
  a11y.md          SVG labelling, contrast, grayscale, focus
skills/          the six skills, each SKILL.md + references/
scripts/         authoring-time tooling — never shipped to readers
templates/       document · longform · deck · gallery · themes · diagram
examples/        committed outputs, doubling as CI fixtures and the shots above
assets/          banner.svg — literal colors, because <img> is an isolated document
docs/screenshots/
tests/           standard library only, so CI needs no install step
```

## Themes

Four themes plus a documented brand slot — see [the comparison above](#four-voices-one-contract).

`console-violet` is the dark one. Its accent is violet rather than the obvious amber because amber measured **6° from `--warning`**, and in a system where status colors are load-bearing an accent that close makes every genuine warning ambiguous. Teal was rejected too — 4° from `executive-navy`, so the two would have been hard to tell apart at thumbnail size.

A dark theme must also restore a dark ink ramp for print. `core/print.css` flattens surfaces to white but deliberately leaves the ink ramp alone, so a dark theme that skips this prints white on white. A test fails any dark theme without it.

Because themes select on `[data-theme]` rather than `:root`, and `core/base.css` re-derives its computed tokens at every theme boundary, a single page can carry several themes at once — [`examples/themes-light.html`](examples/themes-light.html) is one document, not four.

A theme changes the visual voice, never the information architecture. It must not change metric definitions, category order, chart scales, included records, or conclusions.

## Tooling

All of it runs on the authoring machine. The delivered artifact is plain HTML and SVG.

```bash
npm install beautiful-mermaid @observablehq/plot jsdom     # renderers
pip install playwright && playwright install chromium      # PDF + screenshots

python3 scripts/build_examples.py       # rebuild every example from source
python3 scripts/shoot_examples.py       # refresh the screenshots above
python3 scripts/build_document.py templates/longform.html --theme field-notes --out rfc.html
python3 scripts/inline_fonts.py rfc.html --font "Geist:400:geist.woff2" --out offline.html
python3 scripts/validate_repository.py .
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests

node scripts/render_diagram.mjs in.mmd --id x --title "…" --desc "…" --out x.svg
node scripts/render_chart.mjs spec.json --out chart.svg
node scripts/export_pdf.mjs report.html --out report.pdf
node scripts/export_pdf.mjs deck.html --out deck.pdf --preset deck   # one slide per page
```

Both renderers wrap their upstream library rather than calling it directly, because raw output is not safe to inline into a designed document. Between them they strip an external Google Fonts request from inside the SVG, namespace generic element IDs that would otherwise collide across two figures on one page, remove fixed pixel dimensions that break print scaling, neutralize a hardcoded white background, and add the accessibility shell. Each is a verified upstream behavior, documented at the point it is handled.

## Verification

`.github/workflows/validate.yml` runs the tests, the repository linter, a template assembly check, and renders a diagram and a chart to assert their output contracts.

`scripts/validate_repository.py` reads the same files the skills read — `core/tokens.md` for the required tokens and `core/themes/*.css` for the palette — so the prose rules and the machine check cannot drift apart. It enforces the two-key frontmatter schema, name↔folder agreement, a mandatory `Do not use for …` clause in every description, complete token coverage in every theme, no color literals outside `core/themes/`, and no broken relative links.

Print is verified by exporting a PDF and looking at it, not by the presence of `@media print`. That check is what caught the report printing its title twice.

## Contributing

1. Skills live at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, frontmatter limited to `name` and `description`.
2. The description states what it does, when to use it, and an explicit `Do not use for …` — these six skills sit close together and will otherwise compete for the same prompts.
3. Keep `SKILL.md` under 400 lines; depth goes in `references/`, and every reference file must be named from `SKILL.md` or it will never load.
4. Adding a token means adding it to every theme, including `brand-template.css`, and documenting it in `core/tokens.md`.
5. No color literals outside `core/themes/`.
6. `python3 scripts/validate_repository.py .` and `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` must pass.
