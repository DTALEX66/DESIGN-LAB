"""The knowledge library: entries a person wrote down, their revisions, and one rebuildable index.

DL-KB-02/03/04. Before this module the repository could *review* a knowledge candidate that a
production run had produced, but there was nowhere to put a piece of knowledge a person wanted to
keep -- a rule, a method, a prompt pattern, a note about a model, a recipe, a case. This is that
place, and it is deliberately small:

* one authoritative writer. Every revision -- created, revised or imported -- goes through
  ``_write_revision``; nothing else inserts into ``knowledge_entry_revision``. The list and detail
  routes read; they never repair, never promote and never fill a gap they noticed.
* one mutable truth source. The canonical bytes live in ``knowledge_entry_revision.document_json``;
  the FTS5 table is derived and ``rebuild_index`` reconstructs it from those rows. The index is
  therefore allowed to be thrown away, and the rebuild route is the proof rather than a comment.
* append-only. A correction is a new revision; the previous one keeps its bytes. "Current" is
  MAX(revision) at read time -- no ``active`` column, because a mutable current-marker is how a
  second truth source is born.

What an entry is NOT: it is not a reviewed KnowledgeCandidate (that flow lives in
``knowledge_review.py`` and has its own human gate), and it is not a verified source. ``source``
uses SourceRecord's own field names (``design-lab/schemas/source-record.schema.json``) so the two
records speak one vocabulary, but it relaxes that record's strictness in exactly one direction:
a field a person did not fill is the literal ``UNKNOWN`` instead of a schema refusal. Nothing is
upgraded to reviewed by being written -- ``source.verification`` is always ``UNVERIFIED``, and the
store refuses a caller that claims otherwise. "The link exists" is not "the source was checked".

Search (DL-KB-04) is FTS5 with ``tokenize='trigram'`` plus a mandatory LIKE fallback. The fallback
is not defensive decoration: a trigram index cannot match a query shorter than three characters,
which is most two-character Chinese words -- ``分镜``, ``粒子``, ``品牌``. The test asserts that the
index alone misses those queries (so the fallback has a failing control), and that the public
search still finds the entries. A search answer also carries *why* each row matched: the field names
and the terms found in them, computed from the stored bytes of the row being returned.
