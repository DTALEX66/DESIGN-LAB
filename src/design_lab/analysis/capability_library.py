"""DL-UI-PLAN: project the existing capability records into one read-only library view.

The library is assembled from documents the repository already maintains and gates;
nothing here discovers, installs, qualifies or downloads a capability:

* ``vendor/sources.lock.json``       - the 46 SourceRecords (license, disposition,
  presence, content digest, observation date);
* ``vendor/sources.revisions.json``  - commit revisions recovered by exact
  repository-path join, plus the explicitly unresolved set;
* ``design-lab/readiness/model-radar.json`` - model presence vs claim, with a
  five-stage state vocabulary.

Three rules the tests pin, because they are the failure modes this project keeps
hitting: an absent revision is ``NOT_VERIFIED`` and never "no provenance"; a
capability that has not been qualified reports ``qualified = None`` rather than
``False`` or a score; and every count is derived from the records in this call,
so a stale number cannot be hardcoded into the projection.
