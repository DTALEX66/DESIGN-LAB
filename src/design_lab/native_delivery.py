"""Project-owned native exports and bounded immutable archive downloads.

``create`` publishes the archive *and* the DeliveryReceipt V2 that says what shipped,
from which host, with which digests. ``receipt`` reads that persisted document back and
``readback`` adds what the asset ledger now says about the restores the document promises;
the document is never extended on the way out, because it signs its own bytes. The receipt
is validated by the emitter before it is stored and re-verified on every read, so a delivery
never answers with a document its own bytes contradict, and a rollback reference that names
no current version is reported as unresolved rather than believed. A missing host readback
stays missing: the document this path emits is ``PARTIAL`` by construction and says plainly
what it does not prove.
