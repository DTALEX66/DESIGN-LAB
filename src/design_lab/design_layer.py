"""E-SLICE-01 design layer: Brief / Direction / DesignSystem vertical slice.

This is the single writer for the three design-layer tables added by
``design-lab-state-design-layer-v1.sql`` (schema v2 adds the DB-level
single-choice index, v3 the append-only event log). It is NOT a second runtime,
backend or ledger: it reuses the one local state database, opens it through the
existing creative store connection (which applies the additive design-layer
migration),
and reuses the shared ``operation_intent`` idempotency table for crash-safe,
retried-but-not-duplicated writes.

The slice is structural, not a Host run and not a Human-Jury acceptance:
  * a Brief is the recorded "what we are designing and why";
  * a Direction is one concrete visual stance under a brief; choosing one sets
    ``chosen`` as the single source of truth for that decision;
  * a DesignSystem binding binds the chosen direction to ONE catalog design
    system (validated against the packaged ``design-lab/design-systems``
    manifests), so a future Build/Review step has a fixed design contract.

Readback is the persisted record itself; evidence is the recorded spec digests,
the chosen-actor fact and the binding spec digest. Nothing here claims E3/E4.

F-2a revision model (``design-lab-state-design-layer-v3.sql``): the content rows
are immutable, the history is ONE append-only ``design_layer_event`` log, and
``chosen`` stays the materialized record of the human choice. Every write path
appends its event inside the SAME transaction as the state change it describes;
``revise_brief`` / ``revise_direction`` append a NEW content row
(version = old + 1) and only move the superseded row's ``superseded_by``
pointer (no content column is ever rewritten); ``lineage_brief`` /
``lineage_direction`` read the chain back, oldest version first.

        * ``UNKNOWN_DESIGN_SYSTEM`` (400) -- the name is not in the packaged

          not exist here;
        * ``TOKEN_DOCUMENT_INVALID`` (400, with field-path ``detail``) -- the
          document fails the DTCG schema or the canonical semantic contract;
          validation runs BEFORE anything is persisted, and a pre-2025.10 document
          is refused with the adapter named rather than silently converted;
        * ``TOKEN_VALIDATOR_UNAVAILABLE`` (503) -- no schema validator importable,
          so the document cannot be judged and is not written (fail closed);
        * ``STALE_REVISION`` (409) -- ``expected_version`` is not the live tip, so
          this write would supersede a version its author never saw; the caller
          re-reads the tip and re-applies, exactly the recovery path the brief
          revisions already document;
        * ``TOKEN_DOCUMENT_AMBIGUOUS`` (409) -- more than one live row for the
          pair, which this build cannot produce and refuses to guess a winner for;
        * ``IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`` (409) -- the shared intent table's rule: a
          replayed key with different content;
        * ``TOKEN_WRITER_BUSY`` / ``TOKEN_WRITER_LEASE_LOST`` (409) -- the repo's
          ONE writer lease (``runtime/asset_store.py``) fenced by generation.

        A published version is never mutated: the new row is an append and the
        previous row only moves its ``superseded_by`` pointer, and the v4 schema's
        BEFORE UPDATE OF trigger makes rewriting a content column a database error
