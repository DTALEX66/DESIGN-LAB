"""DL-P0-160: delivery provenance projected onto a C2PA 2.4 claim structure.

What this module is, and what it is not
---------------------------------------
It maps a DESIGN-LAB delivery record onto the structure of a C2PA 2.4 manifest
(``C2PA_SPEC_VERSION = "2.4"``): the 2.x claim structure
``CLAIM_VERSION = "c2pa.claim.v2"``, the reserved signature assertion label
``SIGNATURE_ASSERTION = "c2pa.signature"``, ``claim_generator``, ``assertions``
carrying ``c2pa.actions``, one ``c2pa.ingredient`` per declared input, and
``c2pa.creative-work`` / ``c2pa.training-mining`` where the rights profile
requires them. The manifest names ``c2pa.claim.v2`` and ``c2pa.signature`` so a
later signing pipeline has the exact labels to work with; it carries no signature
*material* and no ``c2pa.signature`` assertion.

The DESIGN-LAB Asset Graph stays the source of truth
----------------------------------------------------
The delivery record -- deliverable identity, artifact digest, producer, lineage
inputs and rights profile -- is DESIGN-LAB's internal Asset Graph, and it is the
**source**. The C2PA document is a *projection* of it: a read-only rendering for
interchange. C2PA never replaces the Asset Graph here -- nothing in this module
writes back into the delivery record, no field of the manifest is authoritative
over it, and :func:`build_manifest` is a pure function from the delivery record to
the projection (``design_lab.projection_of`` records that direction in every
manifest).

**It never signs, never embeds and never claims that a signed asset exists.**
``SIGNING_STATUS = "UNSIGNED_STRUCTURAL_ONLY"`` is written into every manifest and
enforced on every read. :func:`sign` exists only to fail closed with the exact
list of what is missing. Provenance *structure* is the deliverable here; the
signing step (a C2PA signing library, a certificate chain and a private key) plus
embedding into the asset file belong to a release pipeline that DESIGN-LAB has not
run -- and no part of this module has run it either.

Two documented deviations from a signed C2PA manifest, both deliberate
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The ingredient hash is carried in DESIGN-LAB's canonical ``sha256:<64 hex>``
   form under ``sha256``. Translating it into the C2PA assertion's binary
   ``c2pa.hash.data`` structure is a signing-library concern, and inventing that
   shape without running a signing library would be guesswork. :func:`sign` names
   this in its failure message.
2. ``format`` carries DESIGN-LAB's asset kind (``raster``, ``vector``, ...) rather
   than a MIME type, because DESIGN-LAB does not own that mapping.

Boundary: JSON in, JSON out. No network, no process, no file write, no signature.
All evidence reachable from this module is E1 (STRUCTURAL).
