"""The evidence link has to be readable by a person, not only by an axis rule.

`project_ledger` already answers "does this receipt still hold", and since 2026-10-08 it answers two
separate questions -- integrity (are the bytes this receipt hashed still where the receipt says they
came from) and currency (does this receipt still describe the bytes we are running). Until now the
only consumer of those fields was the axis rule inside reporting.py itself: no route, no page, no gate
read them. An answer nobody can look at is not an answer, and a chain whose last link is only visible
to the code that wrote it is exactly where false greens hide.

This module recomputes the projection over the CURRENT checkout -- the ledger file plus the object
database -- and refuses to say anything it cannot support. It never reads `reports/current/`, because
a generated projection is bound to whatever commit it was written at, and serving that as the state of
the code you are running would be the same substitution of stale evidence for observation that the
ledger has been fighting all week. If the ledger is absent, if git cannot name a subject commit, or if
the record set has outgrown the contract's bound, the call raises with a named code instead of
answering an empty list that a reader would call "no evidence problems".
