    # ("仓库责任"): apps, src, packages, integrations, design-lab, fixtures,
    # research, vendor, docs, reports, scripts, .project, .project-local.
    # `.project-local` is admitted only for task-artifacts/ (see below), and
    # `.project` is the tracked governance root.
    #
    # `apps` was added 2026-09-27 because AUTHORITY.md §3 declares the Workbench
    # the first-class user-visible front end ("DESIGN-LAB 有前端：apps/workbench/").
    # Without it NO evidence receipt could cite the front end at all, so the R5
    # ledger could not record a single front-end fact — a governance gap, not a
    # safety property.
    #
    # `research` and `vendor` were added in the same pass: an audit of this set
    # against §7 found them missing too, the identical defect class. Leaving them
    # out would have re-created the gap for §7's own declared roots.
    #
    # Owner intent: 2026-09-27, "加入，全部开始" (answering the finding recorded in
    # the project survey). Rationale: a receipt may cite what the Authority
    # already declares repository-authoritative. Superseded: the previous 8-root
    # and 10-root sets. Impact: apps/**, research/** and vendor/** become
    # citable; nothing else widens.
    #
    # The secret guard is deliberately NOT widened: `denied` below still applies
    # to every path component, so `.env*` / auth.json / credentials.json /
    # tokens.json / id_rsa remain rejected ANYWHERE in the tree — verified for
    # `apps/workbench/.env` and `apps/auth.json`. apps/, research/, vendor/ and
