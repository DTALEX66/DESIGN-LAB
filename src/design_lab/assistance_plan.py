"""The assistance plan: one neutral design intent, its revisions, and who adopted one.

DL-KB-07, extended by DL-KB-11. A short task should not need a complete project before it can be
written down. This module is the object that holds the intent itself -- objective, output type,
neutral creative, brand/role constraints, lens and sound requirements, the shot rows a 分镜表 is
made of, external steps, known gaps and the material revisions it was built from -- and it reuses
the repository's existing objects for everything it can: the project owns it, and brief / direction
/ prompt result / asset references carry the revision and digest they had when the plan was written.

Four facts are kept apart on purpose, because the screen has to show them apart:

* **saved** -- the plan's bytes are in the state database. That is all a write answer claims.
* **provided** -- the current revision carries a neutral creative. A draft with an objective and
  no creative is saved but not provided, and the readback says so.
* **chosen** -- a named human adopted a revision (``assistance_plan_choice``). The table's CHECK
  refuses any other actor_kind, so an application bug cannot file an agent's choice as a person's.
* **externally verified** -- always false. No route in this repository dispatches an external
  step, so the readback carries the constant and the schema pins it with ``const: false``: turning
  it true requires a contract change, not a flag flip.

Analysis is never inferred from a reference. A plan that names an asset is *linked* to it; the
readback reports ``ANALYZED`` only when a stored reversal (``prompt_result`` with kind REVERSAL)
exists for that asset at its current digest. When a reference is only registered as a link, every
surface reads ``LINKED_ONLY`` -- there is no branch that upgrades it because the plan mentions it.

Like the knowledge library, one writer appends revisions and "current" is MAX(revision) at read
time. A plan's revision pins the revisions of its references; if a referenced object moves on, the
readback reports the reference as CHANGED rather than quietly showing the new bytes as if they were
what the plan used.

        「新版本不覆盖历史；对比页读的是两份真实修订」 had no second document to read -- it would have
        had to guess the older text or compare hashes. This route answers one row's own stored

        ``created_by`` are this row's own columns, while ``latest_revision`` says where the plan has
        since moved. ``is_chosen`` is the same one query the readback's ``choice`` is computed from,
        so the two routes cannot disagree about which revision a person adopted.

        A revision read says nothing about whether anything ran, and no flag here implies it did:
        the plan's four states stay the readback's answer rather than being restated as a second
        copy that could drift, and ``does_not_say`` is that store's own list, verbatim. The
        document travels by ``$ref`` into ``assistance-plan-v1.schema.json`` -- the contract the
