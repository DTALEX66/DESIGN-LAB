"""Service façade for the Human RIGHTS decisions of one project.

``assurance/rights_ledger.py`` is storage; this is the layer a route and a verb call. It
checks the project exists, maps storage refusals to HTTP-meaningful status and codes, and
owns the one word a reader can be misled by: ``rights_clearance``.

The clearance rule, and why it is written the way it is:

* ``CLEARED`` requires at least one use scope on file **and** a current ``APPROVED`` for
  every scope that is currently on file. ``0 of 0`` is vacuously "all approved", and a
  project nobody has filed anything for has not been cleared by anybody -- the same
  mistake ``jury_review.py`` and ``quality_store.py`` each had to close.
* everything else is ``NOT_REVIEWED``, including a project whose filed decision is
  ``DENIED`` or ``BLOCKED_BY_LICENSE``. That is not sloppiness: ``NOT_REVIEWED`` is the
  word this vocabulary has for "the gate does not read as cleared", and the read-back
  publishes ``approved_scope_count`` / ``filed_scope_count`` / ``unapproved_scopes`` next
  to it, so a reader can tell "nobody filed anything" from "a human refused it" instead of
  being asked to trust one word for both. ``PENDING_REVIEW`` is **not** emitted here at
  all: it is a word a human may file (the contract allows it), never a word the façade may
  infer, because "somebody has been asked and owes an answer" is a claim about a request
  that may not have been made. An untouched gate reads NOT_REVIEWED -- the load-bearing
  rule ``creative/approval.py`` states for the projected gates.
* the clearance covers the scopes this project filed, not every subject that needs a
  decision. This ledger holds no requirements list and does not read
  ``design-lab/config/rights-registry.json``; ``does_not_prove`` says so on every response.
