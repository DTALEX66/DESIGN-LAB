"""Read-only projection of the committed Domain Packs (ODA4-0204, Spec V2).

Domain packs are repository-committed records, not per-project or machine-local
state, so this reads them from the package's own repository root -- the same root
`design-lab/scripts/verify_domain_pack_v2.py` is run against in CI. It installs,
generates, validates-by-hand and adjudicates nothing: it lists what is on disk and
reports the repo's own checker verdict per pack.

Measured in this checkout on 2026-10-08, before this module existed:

* ``design-lab/domain-packs/`` holds 13 pack directories;
* 12 of them pass ``design-lab/scripts/verify_domain_pack_v2.py``;
* ``minigame-design/manifest.json`` declares ``workflow/domain-pack/v1`` and that
  checker rejects it (11 errors; the first is ``'domain' is a required property``,
  because the v1 manifest has no ``domain``/``files`` at all).

The Workbench's ``#/domains`` slot therefore claimed "13 个域包" while the repo's
checker accepts 12. This projection does not settle which number a reader wants; it
reports the directory count, the per-pack verdict and the checker's reasons, all
derived in the call, so no page can carry a hand-typed number again.

Three rules the tests pin, because they are this project's recurring failure modes:

1. the verdict comes from the repo's own checker module, so a pack this route
   presents as VALIDATES cannot be one the checker would reject;
2. a pack that cannot be read, or that the checker could not be run for, gets an
   explicit state (``UNREADABLE`` / ``NOT_CHECKED``) -- it is never omitted from the
   list and never folded into ``VALIDATES``;
3. a manifest field the pack does not declare is ``null``, never a defaulted string,
   so a v1 pack does not start reporting the v2 identity it never claimed.
