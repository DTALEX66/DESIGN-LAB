"""Persist ResearchFinding documents against the state database.

``design-lab/schemas/research-finding.schema.json`` declared ``finding_id``/``claim``/
``sourceRefs`` for a long time with nothing in ``src/`` loading it, while
``design-lab/config/object-model.json`` already named the object and pointed at that file.
The declared-but-unread shape is the false-green this repository's own ledger gate exists to
convict, so this module's whole design constraint is: **the schema file is the check.** The
field list, the required trio, the confidence enum and the closed property set are read out
of the file on every run (:func:`contract`), never copied here -- a second copy is a second
authority able to disagree with the first.

What is enforced here is what a JSON Schema cannot see:

* the finding must belong to a project this state database actually has;
* **a finding with no source is a guess.** The schema already declares ``sourceRefs`` as
  required with ``minItems: 1``, and that is only as strong as the validator's arithmetic:
  ``[" "]`` and ``["", ""]`` satisfy ``minItems``. So the rule is enforced in its spirit --
  the list must hold at least one real reference the caller can name, every entry must be a
  non-blank string, and listing one source twice does not make it two. The list field is
  found structurally (:func:`source_ref_field`: the required field the contract declares as
  an array), so a contract that renames it moves this guard with it instead of leaving it
  checking a name nobody uses any more;
* history is append-only. A changed mind is a NEW row carrying ``supersedes``, one row cannot
  be superseded twice, and a supersede must stay inside the same project -- otherwise a later
  filing could retire a finding of another project and both projects would read a chain that
  does not exist. ``supersedes`` is a *column*, never a document field, because the contract
  closes its properties and does not declare one. Immutability itself belongs to the database
  (the triggers in ``design-lab-state-research-v1.sql``), not to a convention of this module;
* every stored row is re-validated on the way out (:func:`list_findings`), including that the
  source list in the bytes still matches the count column it was stored with.

The actor rule, and why it is NOT the rights rule. A research finding is working state, not a
human gate: AGENTS.md puts the Quality/Rights/Production gates behind human approval and puts
research findings on neither. So an agent may record one -- refusing that would just hide who
said it -- but it may not record one **as a human**. Three facts are kept apart instead of
collapsed into one word: an actor that DECLARES ``HUMAN``/``PANEL`` while naming automation is
refused outright (``RESEARCH_NOT_HUMAN``: a machine signing itself as a person is the lie this
guard exists for); an actor whose declared kind is in neither vocabulary is refused
(``RESEARCH_ACTOR_KIND_UNKNOWN``: a reader cannot be asked to guess); and a caller that states
nothing is stored with ``recorded_by`` NULL and reported in ``unattributed_findings``, which is
what every HTTP-filed finding is, because the closed contract has no field to carry an author.
A declared kind is a stronger claim than an absent one and is stored in its own column so the
read-back can tell the three apart. No function here invents an identity.

This is also where the long-term-knowledge boundary is stated rather than assumed. DESIGN-LAB
owns the audited working finding; ArcheAxis owns the truth, and a finding leaves only as a
rights-checked, human-approved ``KnowledgeCandidate``. Nothing in this module exports,
promotes, or reads anything as knowledge: :data:`DOES_NOT_PROVE` says so on every read-back,
and the row itself carries no state field that could be mistaken for one -- which is why there
is deliberately no ``recorded_at`` column either. The contract declares no timestamp and this
store will not invent a moment nobody stated, so ordering is insertion order and the read-back
says it does not know when anything was said.

Every refusal is a :class:`ResearchStoreError` with a distinct ``code``: "that project does not
exist here", "that document is not a finding", "that finding cites no source" and "a machine
tried to sign as a person" are four different facts, and an operator told "invalid" can act on
none of them.

Boundary: no provider call, no host access, no web fetch, no corpus read. It stores what a
caller claimed to have found and where it says it came from, and refuses everything else.
