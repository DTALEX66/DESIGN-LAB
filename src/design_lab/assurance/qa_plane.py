"""DLDS-F070 frozen QA policy: which plane may produce which outcome.

This module is the QA plane of DESIGN-LAB. It does **not** replace the existing
quality gate (``verify_quality_gate``, ``verify_production_preflight``,
``packages/capabilities/quality/**``, ``design-lab/schemas/quality-gate.schema.json``);
it separates that work into three explicitly non-interchangeable planes and
fixes the outcome vocabulary and the evidence ceiling of each one, so a
deterministic check, a model recommendation and a human verdict can never be
confused:

* ``DETERMINISTIC`` -- reproducible rules (preflight, structural and anti-slop
  checks, rights/security checks). Allowed outcomes ``PASS`` / ``WARN`` /
  ``HARD_BLOCK``. Ceiling E1/E2, ``can_block``.
* ``MODEL_ASSISTED`` -- providers and expert-agent critique. Allowed outcomes
  ``PASS`` / ``WARN`` / ``REVIEW_REQUIRED``. Ceiling E2/E3, ``can_block`` false:
  it may recommend and escalate, never veto and never sign, and it may never
  produce a final ``REJECT``/``REJECTED``.
* ``HUMAN`` -- the Human Gate (professional jury, DL-QLT-002). Its only outcomes
  are the final verdicts ``APPROVE`` / ``REJECT``. Ceiling E4, ``can_block``, and
  the only plane allowed to carry a ``verdict``.

The policy is declared once, as :data:`POLICY_ROWS` (the four frozen rows:
deterministic QA, rights/security, model-assisted QA, human jury), and is
projected onto the three planes by :data:`OUTCOMES_BY_KIND`.
:func:`check_policy` refuses any drift between the two, and
:func:`validate_finding` refuses an outcome a plane may not produce.

The rights/security row is a *check family*, not a fourth plane: rights and
security preflight are deterministic, repeatable rules in this repository, so
they share the ``qa-deterministic`` plane and are bound to its allowed set
(``HARD_BLOCK`` plus the non-blocking outcomes, never ``REVIEW_REQUIRED`` and
never a final rejection). A fourth plane kind would either leave a declared
pipeline layer unclaimed or claim one twice, which
:func:`check_plane_inventory` refuses.

``QA_PLANES`` maps the layer ids declared in
``packages/capabilities/quality/pipeline-layers.json`` onto those three planes,
and :func:`check_plane_inventory` refuses an inventory that leaves a declared
pipeline layer unclaimed, claims an unknown layer or claims one layer twice, so
the two documents cannot drift silently.

Boundary: this module is structural validation and aggregation only. It never
runs a check, calls a provider, reads an artifact, writes a record or records a
human decision; :func:`aggregate` only reports which plane still owes one, and
``PASS`` remains unreachable without a human verdict.
