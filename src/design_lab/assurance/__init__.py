"""DLDS-F070 assurance package boundary and primitives.

This package owns the separated assurance planes of DESIGN-LAB:

* :mod:`~design_lab.assurance.qa_plane` -- the QA plane split (deterministic /
  model-assisted / human) and its evidence ceilings;
* :mod:`~design_lab.assurance.human_jury` -- the human jury record structure;
* :mod:`~design_lab.assurance.quality_record` -- the sealed per-artifact
  QualityRecord (DL-CLOUDAUDIT-B3): three physically separated fields
  ``quality.{deterministic, automated_judge, human_jury}`` that cannot overwrite
  one another, a validator, and the guarantee that an automated judge can never
  reach the gate or fill the human field.

A knowledge-feedback candidate module was parked out of the tree by
DL-TP-20260914-DEEPSEEK-AUTHORITY-R1::DLDS-A040: no current task requires it and
knowledge migration is explicitly deferred. See
``reports/current/DEEPSEEK-WORKTREE-INVENTORY.json``.

Boundary: structural contracts and validators only. Nothing in this package
runs a check, calls a provider, opens a host, reads an artifact, writes a file,
touches the network or invents a human identity. Work that would need a live
tool or a real human fails closed with :class:`AssuranceError`.

Evidence rule held by every module here: an AI agent may never sign a human
gate. No function in this package can produce a human verdict, a human
attestation or an approved export; automated planes may only ever produce a
recommendation. The shared primitives below exist so the three modules cannot
drift apart on what a digest, a timestamp or an identifier is.
