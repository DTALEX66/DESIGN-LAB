"""Build the delivery BOM the declared contract describes, or refuse and name what is missing.

Until this module existed the only thing in the product named ``bom`` was the fragment
``{'items': [{'id', 'path', 'sha256'}]}`` that ``assurance/production_preflight.py`` assembled from a
bundle manifest to answer its own link check -- renamed on 2026-10-08 to ``link_manifest`` precisely
because it is not a bill of materials. That fragment is not the declared document either:
``design-lab/schemas/bom.schema.json`` requires ``version``, ``handoff``, ``items[]`` with ``path``,
``kind``, ``format``, ``sha256``, ``source``, ``license``, and ``provenance`` with ``boundTreeSha``,
``generatedAt``, ``environment``, ``toolVersion``, ``inputHash`` -- every object closing extras with
``additionalProperties: false``. Running the fragment through that schema rejects it, which is how a
declared contract stays unfalsified for months: nobody executed the check the contract implies.

So the boundary is stated in code, and where the delivery path records nothing this module refuses
instead of inventing. What the bundle manifest does give:

* ``files[]`` -- member name (path), ``sha256``, ``role`` (primary / preview / input), which decides
  ``kind`` and, from the member suffix, ``format``;
* ``metadata`` -- the host and host version (``provenance.environment``), the job digest
  (``provenance.inputHash``), the registered input asset ids (item ``source`` for an input) and the
  rights state recorded at delivery (item ``license``).

What no stored artifact states, so a caller must attest it or :func:`build` declines: which handoff
document the bill belongs to, which repository tree the delivery was made from, and which tool
version produced it. A BOM that wrote ``unknown`` in those three places would validate and still
read as a bill of materials, which is the false green this file exists to prevent.
