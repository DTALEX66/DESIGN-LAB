"""Persist Human RIGHTS gate decisions against the state database.

The RIGHTS gate was the only human gate with a contract and no store.
``design-lab/schemas/contracts/rights-decision.schema.json`` closed its properties and
froze its decision enum; ``design-lab/config/rights-registry.json`` recorded 74 licence
subjects; ``assurance/handoff_readiness.py`` computed ``_rights_gates`` verdicts. Nothing
in ``src/`` read any of them, so no verb, no route and no release check could cite a
rights decision, and an untouched gate had no word left that could not be mistaken for
"somebody is about to close it".

This module owns *storage* only. Every structural rule stays with the contract that
already had it: the document is validated against ``rights-decision.schema.json`` **as
loaded from disk** -- the field list, the required trio and the decision enum are read out
of that file, never copied here, because a second copy is a second authority able to
disagree with the first. What is enforced here instead is what a JSON schema cannot see:

* the decision must belong to a project this state database actually has;
* history is append-only. A changed mind is a NEW row carrying ``supersedes``, one row
  cannot be superseded twice, and a decision may only supersede a decision about the same
  ``use_scope`` -- otherwise a later filing could hide an unfavourable scope behind an
  unrelated id. ``supersedes`` is a *column*, never a document field: the contract closes
  its properties and does not declare it, so a submission that tried to smuggle one in is
  refused as an unknown field rather than silently stored. The immutability itself is the
  database's (the triggers in ``design-lab-state-rights-v1.sql``), not a convention of this
  module;
* **absence is not a review.** This module deliberately offers no "open a review", "request
  a decision" or default-decision function. A scope nobody filed has no entry in
  :func:`current_decisions`, and nothing here can synthesise the ``PENDING_REVIEW`` that the
  contract allows as a *human* answer. An untouched gate reads ``NOT_REVIEWED`` at the
  façade; ``PENDING_REVIEW`` appears only because a person filed it. That is the same
  load-bearing rule ``creative/approval.py`` applies to the projected gates;
* no decision may be signed by automation.

The actor rule, stated honestly. The contract closes its properties and declares **no**
actor kind, so :func:`human_jury.assert_not_agent_signed` -- which reads a ``juror`` object
-- does not apply to a rights decision, and there is no in-document kind to check. What is
done instead is refusal by name: an actor whose declared ``actor_kind`` is not human is
refused, and an actor whose ``decided_by`` *names* automation is refused outright
(``review-agent``, ``MODEL``, ``SYSTEM``, ``codex``, ...). A name check proves the record
does not declare itself automation. It cannot prove a human typed it, and no function here
invents a human identity: the out-of-band E4 Human Gate attestation still owns that proof,
exactly as ``human_jury.py`` states of its own limit. A declared kind is stronger than a
name check and is stored in its own column, so a reader can tell the two apart instead of
being shown one confident word for both.

Every refusal is a :class:`RightsLedgerError` with a distinct ``code``: "that project does
not exist here", "that document is not a rights decision" and "an agent tried to sign a
human gate" are three different facts, and an operator told "invalid" can act on none of
them.

Boundary: no host access, no provider call, no legal opinion, no registry read. It stores
what a human decided and refuses everything else.
