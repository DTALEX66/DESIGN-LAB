"""Reversible project-state backups with read-back verification.

The runtime root is gitignored, so anything that lives only there disappears on
the next cleanup or machine move. That is not theoretical: a 2026-10-06 cleanup
removed `task-runtime/service/state.db`, which was the index for 346 asset and
native-plan files that exist nowhere else, and no shadow copy was reachable.

A backup here is a single zip with a manifest of per-file sha256 values, and a
restore re-hashes every file it writes before reporting success. Paths are
sanitised on both sides: an archive cannot write outside the target root, and a
non-empty target is refused unless the caller explicitly overwrites.

Two guarantees the first version did not have, both learned from that incident:

* the archive appears only once it has been read back, and a restore installs
  from a staged copy, so an interrupted run leaves the previous state standing
  rather than half-replaced;
* the state database is snapshotted through SQLite's backup API, so a live
  database is captured as one consistent transaction set -- including anything
  already committed into its WAL -- instead of copying file bytes that may split
  a commit across `state.db` and `state.db-wal`.

What that still does *not* give: a writer that touches the files without ever
recording to the state database is invisible to this barrier. Everything the
product itself publishes does record (the writer lease, the publication journal,
the host guard and the attempt row), so the archive can prove no such writer
moved during the capture -- but the proof is only as good as the record, and a
root whose database carries none of those tables reports
`WRITES_NOT_OBSERVABLE` rather than pretending to be quiet.

    WHY THIS IS THE SAFE FORM. `asset_publication` is the crash journal
    `publish_version` writes before it renames, and `recover_publications` reads it
    back with `WHERE store_root=? AND state='PREPARED'`. The four columns here are
    pure filesystem coordinates, so the same rebase the artifact index already gets
    applies to them: left archived-stale, the new root's recovery selects nothing
    and the in-flight publication is neither recovered nor reported, while a
    COMMITTED row makes `publish_version` raise 'publication path escapes store
    root' over bytes that are in fact sitting beside the index. Selecting by
    identity instead -- dropping the `store_root=?` predicate -- would widen every
    live root's recovery to rows belonging to other stores, so the journal text is
    corrected and the predicate is not.

    Only path data is rewritten. `state`, `sha256`, `holder_attempt_id`,
    `generation`, `version_id`, `publication_id`, `asset_id` and `created_at` stay
    exactly as archived: they are the fenced writer's verdict and identity, and
    re-dating or re-fencing a journal row would launder a claim this root never
    made. Nothing here claims the journal's bytes are proven either -- a PREPARED
    row may hold a partial staged copy by design (recovery quarantines it, or
    reports MISSING), so no digest is re-checked here; the artifact index is where
    `_relocate_artifact_paths` proves bytes against digests.

    What this deliberately does NOT touch:
    * `native_host_guard_v1` -- it carries no path column, and its claim is
      non-expiring on purpose ('Host guards deliberately never expire',
      native_tasks.py). Clearing, re-dating or re-keying a restored guard would let
      a second writer share a host the archived attempt may still be holding.
    * `native_execution_v1` and the attempt/operation state -- signed execution
      records, never rewritten per the standing owner ruling; that is why the
      receipt reports REPLAN_REQUIRED_AFTER_RELOCATION instead of repointing them.

    A journal row naming a path outside the archived local root is refused, exactly
    as an artifact row naming one is: it indexes bytes nobody backed up.
