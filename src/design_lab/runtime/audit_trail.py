"""Read back the writer journal that the asset store has always written.

``audit_event`` was written in two places -- an asset version created under an attempt, and a
``writer_takeover`` -- and read by nothing in the product. A journal nobody can read is not an
audit trail: it looks like one in the schema and answers no question at runtime. The takeover
row is the one that matters most. ``takeover_writer`` deliberately increments the generation
and hands a resource to a new holder, which is how a stalled or crashed holder stops blocking
a project; after it happens, the operator's next question is "who took what over, and when",
and today the only way to ask is to open SQLite by hand.

Read-only by construction: the connection is opened ``mode=ro``, so this module cannot be the
place where a journal quietly gains a writer.

The ``actor`` column holds an attempt id, not a person. Nothing here turns it into a name:
an identity claim the stored bytes cannot support would be exactly the false green the rest of
this project is built to refuse.
