"""DLDS-F040 — Approval, projected from the decision ledger.

An approval is not a second kind of decision: it *is* a decision taken at a named
gate by a human. So the authoring source stays ``decision_event`` and this module
does two things:

* answers approval questions over that ledger (``approval_status``,
  ``pending_approvals``, ``require_approval``);
* maintains the pre-existing ``approval`` table of ``design-lab-state-v1.sql`` as
  a **projection** of it, so that table stops being an unused skeleton without
  becoming a second truth.

The human rule is not re-implemented here: ``decision_ledger`` refuses to let an
agent decide or reverse a gate, and this module cannot bypass that. An agent can
propose an approval and can read one; it can never grant one.
