"""Creative Execution OS store: one database, additive migration, no fork.

Wave B (DL-P0-020/021/022/030/031/032/040) extends the existing local state
database with job, lineage, ledger and guard tables. The v1 tables stay frozen:
this module never rewrites ``asset_version`` rows, only adds lineage columns at
migration time. ``.project-local/state/design-lab.db`` remains the single
runtime database; there is no second store, no second writer and no host call.
