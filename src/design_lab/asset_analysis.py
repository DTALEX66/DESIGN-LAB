"""Turn a stored raster asset plus an explicit OCR observation into a reconstruction IR.

The bridge already existed and was tested: ``analysis.decomposition.Plan.from_ocr`` maps bounded convex
quadrilaterals and ``analysis.plan_to_rir`` lowers a Plan to a schema-valid
``design-lab/reconstruction-ir/v1``. What never existed was a caller outside ``design-lab/tests``, so the
only structure a target package could carry was what a person typed into the page. This module is that
missing seam: it reads bytes the asset store already verified and hands them to the existing bridge.

It performs no inference and calls no model. OCR observations are supplied by the caller, because no
local OCR backend is qualified today (``design-lab/readiness/model-radar.json`` reports
``QUALIFIED_LOCAL=0`` and every entry ``default_enabled: false``). An empty or absent observation list is
refused rather than answered with an empty document, because an empty IR would read like an analysis that
found nothing.

The produced document binds itself to the stored bytes through ``provenance.evidence``, which carries the
img-ID the import route registered rather than a filesystem path. A ``raster`` node appears only when
``materialize_raster_regions`` stages one, so an unmaterialised remainder stays a group marked
``inferred`` — the bridge never invents a background layer to fill the gap.
