## Contract Graph Report

Contract graph: 11 concepts, 0 unresolved links, verdict NO_BROKEN_LINK.
Consumer edges are verified, not asserted: a declared consumer must reference the concept's producer module, table or schema in executable code. Comments and docstrings do not count.
An independent audit found one fictional edge (QA named a file that never referenced its producer); widening the same check found five more, and all six declarations were replaced with verified readers. The structural finding behind them is recorded in the graph: no production Python module imports another creative concept module, because those concepts are peers joined through the state database.
creative-v1 migration was rehearsed to completion on a copy (15/15 steps, zero writes to any pre-existing database) and is still marked MIGRATION_CANDIDATE_PENDING_AUDIT, not accepted as production.
Standards alignment: DTCG 2025.10 canonical with legacy behind an adapter, OTIO official transition offsets, C2PA 2.4 claim structure (unsigned and never signed here), Penpot v3 archive validation, GLB accessor matrix coverage, QA automation/model/human boundary.
