# DESIGN-LAB × UI-kit conformance archive — 2026-09-28

**Archive root:** `docs/audits/DESIGN-LAB-UIKIT-CONFORMANCE-2026-09-28/`
**Baseline `main` at archive time:** `3d0ad1cd51869c288e8d3870af8c2541f7bb505f`
**Round PRs:** #182 (`.seg` primitive → `553b0ca4`), #183 (route-heading de-couple → `3d0ad1c`)

> This is a **HISTORICAL / EVIDENCE archive**, not a current authority, not a task
> dispatch entry and not a ledger. Per `AGENTS.md`, the top-level authority remains
> `/AUTHORITY.md` (`DL-AUTHORITY-2026-09-18-R2`). Nothing here may be used to edit
> execution state or to claim a capability-axis promotion.

## 1. What this archive is

The DESIGN-LAB workbench is a 1:1 replica of the in-repo **B10** UI kit. This archive
records one round of work that made that claim **measurable** rather than asserted:
auditing, per computed CSS property, whether the B10 shell (`.app`) still depended on
pre-B10 legacy CSS, and closing the dependency that was found.

## 2. Provenance

| Input | Origin | Identity |
|---|---|---|
| Owner task pack | `DESIGNLAB_商业级前端与能力闭环_后续任务包_20260928.zip` | sha256 `70592198dbd4ea0228ab1714143ec9e230f90237d19247b8831d586d64cfae85` |
| UI-kit originals | owner batch **B04** (component system / tokens), **B07** (front-end spec), **B10** (final hi-fi deployable UI) | extracted from the owner's own per-project archives under `D:\All projects\UI套件` |

⚠️ **Only the per-project `DESIGN-LAB_*` archives were used.** The three-project
"全量包" bundles mix ArcheAxis and WORK-LAB material; using them for a DESIGN-LAB 1:1
replica would cross-contaminate colour and specification. This warning was carried in
the pack and is confirmed correct.

## 3. Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `pack/` | The owner-supplied pack documents, verbatim (`00_README` … `04_SOURCES`, `ALIGNMENT-ANALYSIS`, `EXTRACTION-MANIFEST`) |
| `findings/` | Work-package deliverables — `W00` crosswalk / diff-mapping / evidence-scan, `W01` typography matrix, `W02` component coverage + decision + **`W02-LEGACY-COUPLING`**, `W03` project-detail route, `W14` viewport/keyboard |
| `evidence/` | Raw, unedited harness outputs (`W02-LEAK-SWEEP.txt`, `*-VERIFY.json`, `*-PROBE.json`) |
| `evidence/local-gates/` | Gate results: fresh runs for this round (`license-coverage`, `identity-gate`, `top-level-authority`, `context-integrity`, each `exit=0`) plus the session's earlier gate JSON (`authority-gates-latest`, `top-authority-gates-latest`, `control-spike-bad-matrix`, `browser-e2e-summary`, `test-run`) |
| `harness/` | The audit tooling that produced `evidence/` — runnable, SPDX-tagged |
| `session/` | Session lineage: commit/PR message drafts, superseded revisions, intermediate probes. **Superseded, kept only for traceability** |
| `session/project-survey-2026-09-27/` | The preceding round's project-survey documents, carried over for completeness (their own tracked handover is `docs/handoffs/DESIGN-LAB-PROJECT-SURVEY-TRUTH-RESYNC-2026-09-27.md`) |
| `ui-originals/` | Extracted reference originals (`B04/`, `B07/`, `B10/`) + `EXTRACTION-MANIFEST.json`. The 17 B04 design sheets carry `asset-sidecar/v1` **JSON** sidecars |
| `ui-kit/` | The wider local UI-kit tree: the batches **not** already in `ui-originals/` (`B08/`, `B09/`), the live `B10-batch/`, `mockups/`, `chromium-probe.mjs`. `B04/`, `B07/` and `B10/` were **removed as byte-identical duplicates** of `ui-originals/` (verified by sha256: 18/18, 23/23, 2/2, the two remainder files differing only by the ASCII renames below) |
| `findings/ui-implementation/` | The earlier UI implementation docs: component map, route map, reference manifest, asset-replacement manifest, visual-QA report |
| `evidence/deep-audit/` | `dl-deep-audit` batch outputs (child results, library-index audit, report skeleton) |
| `evidence/governance-state/` | `context-capsule.json`, both `prune-manifest-*.json`, `stash-backup-2026-09-26.json` |
| `session/b10-1to1-handoff/` | Text-only lineage from the B10 1:1 round (42 files). Its Chromium profile/shader-cache trees were excluded — see §11 |
| `session/quarantine/`, `session/hermes-legacy/`, `session/reconstruction/` | Quarantined deepseek-round1 state, HERMES legacy migration manifests/journal, reconstruction run contracts |

## 4. The headline result

`W02-LEAK-SWEEP.txt` deletes every unscoped, element-only legacy rule through the
CSSOM and diffs **all** computed longhands of every `.app` element across all 12
routes plus the default and login screens (328 elements in `.app`).

| Scope | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| **inside `.app`** (the B10 1:1 subject) | **8** legacy-supplied bindings | **0** |
| outside `.app` (legacy chrome: login, `#workspace`, `nav.app-nav`) | 1923 | 1923 |

The 8 were the placeholder `<h2>` margins on `#/research` and `#/collaboration`,
supplied by the pre-B10 `h2{margin:0 0 14px}` rule. Fixed by declaring the margin in
`.route-view h2` with **exactly the previously computed values**, so the pixels are
unchanged and only the hidden dependency is removed. See `findings/W02-LEGACY-COUPLING.md`.

**Design consequence recorded there:** the 1923 out-of-`.app` bindings are why the
legacy element rules **cannot** simply be scoped to `body > …`. An earlier plan to do
exactly that would have broken the login and workspace screens.

## 5. Reproduction

```bash
# from the repo root; node must be resolvable (the repo pins playwright 1.63.0)
node docs/audits/DESIGN-LAB-UIKIT-CONFORMANCE-2026-09-28/harness/w02-legacy-leak-sweep.mjs
```

The harness serves `apps/workbench/` under the **exact CSP the service sends**
(`default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; …`) and drives the pinned
Chromium. On this machine `playwright@1.63.0` expects chromium-1243 while only 1228 is
installed, so the harness passes an explicit `executablePath`; adjust that constant for
another machine.

The harness carries its own **positive control** (an injected element-only leak must be
reported end-to-end). This is deliberate: three harness bugs in this round each produced
a *false* result before being found — route discovery reading `href` off `<button>`
elements, same-document hash navigation, and `getComputedStyle` returning stale values
when read in the same task as a CSSOM mutation. All three are documented in
`findings/W02-LEGACY-COUPLING.md` §5.

## 6. Deliberate exclusions

Every remaining `.project-local/task-artifacts/` tree was reviewed before archiving; the
two that are **not** here, and why:

- **9 transient Chromium profile directories** (~142 MB) used by the harnesses — browser
  cache state, not work product. They remain under
  `.project-local/task-artifacts/designlab-followup-taskpack-20260928/chrome-profile-*/`.
- **`external-recovery-2026-09-25/`** — contains a bare **git pack** (`*.pack`, `*.idx`,
  `*.rev`) plus recovered HTML/txt. The pack files are binary git internals, are not valid
  UTF-8, and would make the identity gate fail closed on unreadable tracked text; they are
  also not text evidence. Left in `.project-local` deliberately.

Also not re-archived here: prior rounds' artifacts that already have tracked handovers
under `docs/handoffs/` (`external-recovery-2026-09-25`, `browser-e2e` from 09-26, etc. are
represented by their gate JSON in `evidence/local-gates/`).

## 8. Capability claims

No capability-axis promotion is claimed. `host_live` and `delivery` remain at **1/28** and
**0/28**: they require real host hardware and are untouched by this round.

## 9. Compliance notes

- Archived `.py`/`.mjs`/`.js` carry `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` so the
  **License & secret hygiene gate** (`design-lab/scripts/verify_license_coverage.py`)
  stays green.
- The 17 binary design sheets carry **`.license` sidecars in `asset-sidecar/v1` JSON**,
  as required by `verify_asset_governance.py` (DL-AST-001) — free-text SPDX sidecars are
  a hard violation there because they cannot prove hash or rights. Each records
  `sha256`, `license: LicenseRef-Owner-Project-Asset`, the rights holder and the three
  boolean rights flags. **The rights flags are a claim that needs the owner's eye:**
  `redistributable: true`, `commercialUse: true`, and `modelInputAllowed: false`
  (no model-training right is asserted for the sheets). Without a registered `sourceId`
  the schema requires an approved exception, so each carries
  `exception.approvedBy = "DTALEX66 (project owner)"` with `expiresAt: 2027-09-28` —
  grounded in the owner's instruction to archive this round's material into the project.
  **This is an assertion of owner approval, not a verified signature; the owner should
  confirm or amend it before the expiry.**
- Two archived filenames were **non-ASCII** in the source archives and were renamed to
  ASCII, because `git ls-files` quotes such paths and `verify_asset_governance.py` then
  fails with `cannot stat tracked file` (observed on CI, reproduced locally):

  | Original name | Archived as |
  |---|---|
  | `DESIGN-LAB_L4_16张组件系统总览.jpg` | `DESIGN-LAB_L4_B04-16-components-overview.jpg` |
  | `打开页面_Windows.bat` | `open-page_Windows.bat` |

- Every text file here is valid UTF-8: the **identity gate** reads all tracked text and
  fails **closed** on an unreadable file. (This archive's own first sweep output was
  written UTF-16LE by a PowerShell redirect and was caught by that gate.)
- Placed under `docs/audits/` deliberately: `docs/taskpacks/**` is scanned by the
  authority-chain and context-integrity gates, so an archive there could be
  misclassified as a historical taskpack or as an authority claim.

## 10. Gate status for this archive (local, full unified verify)

The failure above was found by running the **full** `verify_design_lab.py`, not by
hand-picking gates — the first push of this archive failed CI on
`verify_asset_governance.py` precisely because only four gates had been run locally.
After the fixes: `verify_design_lab.py` all-pass, `ASSET_GOVERNANCE=OK`,
`LICENSE_COVERAGE=OK`, `IDENTITY_GATE=OK`, `TOP_AUTHORITY_GATE=PASS (10/10)`,
`VERIFY_CONTEXT_INTEGRITY=PASS`.

Full local unit suite: `Ran 1755 tests`, `OK (skipped=37)`, exit 0 — raw log in
`evidence/pytest-undisturbed.txt`. CI's Python gate (which runs
`python scripts/run_python_tests.py`) is green on the merge SHA
`94ed63b96099ef9c1c363f2970502cb04ec92e5e`.

> **A local run of that same suite first reported `errors=2`.** It is not reproducible:
> the module implicated by the visible output (`test_verifier_internals`, which plants
> synthetic secrets such as `.hermes/secret-new.json`) passes 58/58 in isolation, and the
> undisturbed full run is green. That run overlapped this session's own `git add` /
> `commit` / `push` and `verify_language_boundary.py` rewriting
> `reports/current/LANGUAGE-BOUNDARY-SCAN.json` — i.e. the repo state was moving
> underneath a suite that contains repo-state-snapshotting tests. The two error names were
> **not captured** (the output was tail-truncated), so the concurrency explanation is a
> **stated hypothesis, not a proven cause**. What is established: the failure is
> non-reproducible, CI is green, and nothing in it points at this archive.

## 11. Full `.project-local/` reconciliation

Every tree under the runtime root (`.project-local/`, gitignored by design — `AGENTS.md`:
"运行/证据/缓存根统一为 `.project-local/`") has been reviewed and is either **archived
here** or **excluded with a reason**. Measured at archive time; the whole local root is
~1.06 GB, of which ~14 MB is archived.

### Archived

### Excluded — with the reason

| Tree | Files | MB | Why not archived |
|---|---|---|---|
| `runs/` | 2596 | 522 | Runtime run output. The project's declared run/evidence root; regenerable and far too large for git. State it describes is already summarised by tracked reports |
| `projects/` | 346 | 341 | Per-project runtime working sets (the services' own `.project-local`); user/tenant data, not archive material |
| `task-runtime/` | 1280 | 100 | Test/browser harness scratch |
| `cache/` | 1914 | 33 | Regenerable cache |
| 9 × `chrome-profile-*/` + the `chrome-profile*` trees inside `b10-1to1-handoff/audit/evidence/` | ~1900 | ~155 | Chromium profile/cache (incl. `GrShaderCache` shader blobs). Browser state, not work product — the "53 MB of extension-less files" in that handoff are exactly this |
| `task-artifacts/external-recovery-2026-09-25/` | 37 | 1.1 | Contains a bare **git pack** (`*.pack`/`.idx`/`.rev`). Binary git internals, not valid UTF-8, would make the identity gate fail closed on unreadable tracked text |
| `archive/hermes-legacy/` binary files | 138 | ~2.4 | Images inside HERMES legacy state; the text manifests/journal **are** archived |
| `session/hermes-legacy/runtime/final-pack/` (extracted) | 7 | 1.4 | Removed after the identity gate correctly rejected it: 4 files carry the **retired legacy identity string**, which is allowed only in allowlisted history roots (`docs/taskpacks/`, `docs/history/`). Provenance is preserved byte-exactly by the archived **zip** (the identity gate skips `.zip`), so nothing is lost |
| empty dirs (`profile-resolver-tests/`, `reconstruction/` remnants) | 0 | 0 | Nothing to archive |

**Not a claim of infallibility:** the "archived" rows were copied and then gated
(`verify_asset_governance`, `verify_license_coverage`, `verify_identity_gate`,
`verify_context_integrity`, full `verify_design_lab`). Shas are recorded in `file`/`sha256`
sidecars for every binary. Two archive passes already had to be corrected by CI — see
§6, §9 and §10.
