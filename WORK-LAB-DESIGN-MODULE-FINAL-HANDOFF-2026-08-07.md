# WORK-LAB Design Module Final Handoff

> This handoff belongs to `migration/work-lab-design-extraction-20260807`. It is a one-time ownership transfer record, not a WORK-LAB synchronization contract.

## Manifest and decisions

Manifest: `WORK-LAB-OPEN-DESIGN-EXTRACTION-MANIFEST.json`.

| Classification | Count | Decision |
|---|---:|---|
| IDENTICAL | 442 | Do not copy |
| SOURCE_ONLY candidate | 31 | Applied to migration branch and read back |
| SEMANTIC_CONFLICT | 13 | Keep target V3 canonical files; no overwrite |
| HISTORICAL_ONLY_NOT_MIGRATED | 4 | Do not import WORK-LAB root policy/README files |
| LICENSE_BLOCKED | 3 | Hold; no license-unclear content copied |
| TARGET_ONLY | 3 | Preserve; never delete |

The source candidate contained 493 files in the declared design scope. Generated/cache/runtime-state/node_modules/.hermes material was excluded by the manifest. No sensitive file was copied.

## Directory mapping

- `20-design/open-design/opendesign-assistance/` → `opendesign-assistance/`
- `20-design/open-design/design-system/` → `design-system/`
- `20-design/open-design/minigame-runtime/` plus `30-products/minigame/` → `minigame-runtime/` (the MiniGame product tree is the canonical payload; target-only generated GIFs are preserved)
- `20-design/open-design/project-memory/` → `project-memory/`
- design-specific domain packs, schemas, benchmark fixtures and tests → corresponding `opendesign-assistance/` subdirectories
- WORK-LAB root `AGENTS.md`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, and README were not imported as target rules
- `30-products/minigame` was subsequently migrated in the M-150 scope correction; the WORK-LAB source tree was removed only after 422 tracked files passed source/target SHA readback

## Capability and rights boundaries

- Open Design desktop/runtime remains the actual design, canvas, agent-call and artifact surface.
- This repository remains an assistance/enhancement layer: prompts, plugins, scenarios, design systems, templates, schemas, visual-quality protocols, source/provenance records and editable-delivery guidance.
- Master studies and style references are method/protocol material; protected signature copying is not a capability.
- MINIGAME product/runtime content is now owned by this target under `minigame-runtime/`. Platform release, advertising, paid provider smoke and commercial acceptance are not claimed.
- The target main root has no detected `LICENSE` or `NOTICE`; the three license-like source files remain `LICENSE_BLOCKED`. No license decision was invented and no license content was copied.
- Credentials, auth state, cookies, private runtime state and provider state were not migrated.

## Validation evidence

Executed on the migration branch after candidate apply:

- `verify_open_design_assistance.py`: `VERIFY_RESULT=OK total=456 failed=0`
- `verify_product_manifest_v3.py`: `VERIFY_PRODUCT_MANIFEST_V3=OK total=203 failed=0`
- `verify_runtime_contracts_v3.py`: `VERIFY_RUNTIME_CONTRACTS_V3=OK total=223 failed=0`
- `verify_visual_scoring_v3.py`: `VERIFY_VISUAL_SCORING_V3=OK total=10 failed=0`
- `verify_visual_quality_v21.py`: `VERIFY_VISUAL_QUALITY_V21=OK`
- `verify_source_registry_v2.py`: `VERIFY_SOURCE_REGISTRY=OK SOURCES=112 ERRORS=0`
- `verify_v2_protocols.py`: `VERIFY_V2_PROTOCOLS=OK ERRORS=0`
- `verify_benchmark_registry.py`: `BENCHMARK_REGISTRY_PASS benchmarks=12 human_calibration_required=true`
- `verify_evidence_cards.py`: `EVIDENCE_CARDS_PASS cards=12 human_calibration_required=true authoritative_accepts=0`
- `verify_minigame_domain_pack.py`: `MINIGAME_DOMAIN_PACK_BOUNDARY_PASS contract=manifest fixture=minigame-runtime evidence=E2`
- M-150 MiniGame payload readback: initial copy `422 tracked files`, `SHA mismatches=0`; post-verification target build normalization is explicitly recorded as four final byte deltas plus one no-byte-change normalization note
- `git diff --check`: pass

The MINIGAME verifier received a target-layout path fix because its imported source version assumed `domain-packs/` at repository root while the target V3 layout is `opendesign-assistance/domain-packs/`. This is recorded as a target-layout compatibility patch, not source-byte parity.

The target repository declares no separate security-named gate. Security evidence is limited to the main verifier safety-boundary assertions, source-registry checks and protocol checks above; no live runtime, credential, paid-provider, external security audit or production security claim is made.

Evidence levels remain structural/isolated (E1/E2). Open Design live registration, runtime ID/version readback, minimal live task, artifact/provenance live readback, exact-SHA cloud CI and human/commercial acceptance are not claimed here.

## Rollback and recovery

- Before migration branch commit, target `main` remained untouched at its fetched baseline.
- Rollback is `git switch main` and discard/delete only the migration branch after review; no force-push or main rewrite is required.
- Candidate files are source-addressed by the manifest and SHA-256 readback; target-only and target-newer files were not deleted or overwritten.
- WORK-LAB `30-products/minigame` was removed after payload readback; ignored local platform artifacts were preserved outside the Git payload under `.hermes/task-runtime/tmp/`.

## Ownership transfer

From the moment the migration branch remote readback is complete:

> WORK-LAB no longer owns, synchronizes, updates, monitors, or executes Open Design-specific content. `OPEN-DESIGN-Assistance` has an independent lifecycle.

No PR is opened and `main` is not merged by this task. WORK-LAB cutover remains separately gated until this branch's final remote readback is verified.
