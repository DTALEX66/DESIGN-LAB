"""Prose numbers must equal measured numbers.

Two stale figures reached a live surface this session: a source comment that still narrated the
workbench route table as 15 entries (it is 19), and DESIGN.md's "11 nav items need 587px, the list
only overflows below 720" (19 items, and it overflows at every desktop height measured). Both were
believed, and nothing failed. The repo already solves this once -- `scripts/design_debt_baseline.py
--check` compares the debt prose against the measurement -- so this is the same mechanism for the
counts no gate owned yet.

A claim is (file, a template holding exactly one `{n}`, a callable). The measurement reads code,
never the sentence; the sentence is never an input to the measurement -- that separation is the only
thing keeping this from being a tautology. Every extractor fails loudly when it matches nothing,
because a dead pattern that reports 0 would otherwise green-light a wrong document.
