"""Declare (or re-declare) that a landed Record copy was deliberately rewritten.

`record_import_verify.py` holds every `LANDED` / `ALREADY-IN-REPO` row to a recorded digest:
leg 1 against the archived bytes (verified against the source ZIP), leg 2 against the
repository copy. When a later batch intentionally rewrites such a file, leg 2 has no way to
say so -- it can only report WORKTREE-MISMATCH, which makes honest evolution look exactly
like silent corruption. This writes the post-import state onto the row so leg 2 can hold the
file to the truth instead.

What it does NOT do, and why that matters:

* it never touches the archived `sha256` / `crc32` / `bytes` -- those describe the ZIP and
  leg 1 keeps verifying them against the ZIP;
* it never invents a commit. `evolvedBy.commit` is read from `git log` for that exact path,
  so the row names a real commit that really changed the file;
* it never rewrites the gate or lowers a criterion. `verify_record_import_verify.py` still
  refuses the file if it matches neither the archived nor the declared bytes, and still
  refuses a row that declares post-import digests without naming a commit.

Run it with `--check` first to see what would move; nothing is written unless it prints
`UPDATED`.
