"""DLDS-K010 / K020 / K030 / K040 — final DeepSeek closeout.

Every number in this report is read from the artifact that measured it, and every
before/after pair states which artifacts it compares and whether the comparison is
like-for-like. Where a pair is not like-for-like the claim is withdrawn rather than
restated, because an INDEPENDENT AUDIT of this run found exactly that defect: a
"before" figure measured after the change it was supposed to precede.

K010  final cleanup audit  -> reports/current/DEEPSEEK-FINAL-CLEANUP-AUDIT.json
K020  final language audit -> reports/current/DEEPSEEK-FINAL-LANGUAGE-AUDIT.json
K030  final repository audit -> reports/current/DEEPSEEK-FINAL-REPOSITORY-AUDIT.json
K040  evidence packet -> reports/current/DEEPSEEK-TASK-STATE.json and the six
      markdown reports the taskpack names, plus a pointer to the Codex handoff.
