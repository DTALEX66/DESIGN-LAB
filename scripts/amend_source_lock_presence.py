"""Record whether each vendor/sources.lock.json byte claim is reachable at all.

The lock lists 46 sources with a `files` count and a `path`, and
`verify_source_registry.py` answers `SOURCE_REGISTRY=PASS` without ever opening a
single one of those paths. Measured on `main` = `b7f82ac0`, that PASS covers three
very different situations:

  * 3 `ABSORB_MINIMAL` sources whose files are committed, so a clone has them;
  * 37 `CONDITIONAL_POC` sources whose `path` is `.project-local/cache/vendor/<id>`,
    a gitignored directory that exists only on the machine that acquired them
    (`docs/THIRD_PARTY_ISOLATION.md` calls it 保真副本 in cache, by policy);
  * 6 `LOCK_REFERENCE` sources whose `design-lab/intelligence/*` paths were deleted
    from Git on 2026-09-04 and are not anywhere on disk either.

This script writes what is *measured* rather than what is claimed: a `presence`
class derived from `git ls-files` plus the filesystem, a file count from each side,
and a content digest over the bytes that are actually there. It adds no policy and
removes no record; the point is that a reader can no longer mistake "hashed on one
machine" for "in the repository".

Output is deterministic (no timestamps), so the projections that digest this file
stay byte-stable across runs and platforms.
