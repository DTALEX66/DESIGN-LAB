"""DL-AUTHORITY-2026-09-18-R2 — top-level Authority consistency gate.

Deterministic, stdlib-only verifier for the top-level Authority release. It
is the *successor* consistency gate; the DeepSeek predecessor chain
(``scripts/verify_authority_gates.py``) keeps running and stays subordinate —
this gate checks the R2 top-level surface and never re-implements the
DeepSeek lineage chain.

Checks (all fail-closed; any FAIL makes the exit code 1):

1.  ``AUTHORITY.md`` exists at the repository root;
2.  ``.project/governance/authority-index.json`` parses as JSON, is a
    non-empty object, and its ``authorityId`` equals the ID declared in
    ``AUTHORITY.md``;
3.  every path listed in the index ``current`` array exists in the tree;
4.  no path listed as ``current`` is also claimed as historical — a path
    matching ``historicalGlobs`` or listed in ``historicalSpecific`` may
    not be CURRENT;
5.  the current integrated TaskPack (``taskpackClassificationRule.
    currentIntegrated``) exists;
6.  root ``AGENTS.md`` is Authority-first: it carries the
    ``TOP-LEVEL AUTHORITY — MUST READ FIRST`` section and names both the
    authority ID and ``/AUTHORITY.md``;
7.  the UCR convergence handoff, if present, carries the
    ``HISTORICAL_EXECUTION_RECORD / NON_AUTHORITATIVE`` banner and no
    longer claims to be a tracked authority handoff;
8.  the single Ruff fact: ``docs/architecture/LANGUAGE-POLICY.md`` does
    not still carry the stale ``DECLARED_NOT_ENFORCED`` wording;
9.  R2 release integrity: the four landed release files byte-match the
    published R2 MANIFEST hashes (static fact of this release; dynamic
    state such as branch counts or CI numbers are deliberately NOT
    frozen here — they must be live-read on every audit).

The gate is read-only against the working tree: it writes nothing except an
ignored run record under ``.project-local/task-artifacts/`` so the CI job
and the clean-tree gate observe identical facts.
