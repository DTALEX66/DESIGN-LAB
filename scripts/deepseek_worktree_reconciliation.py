"""DLDS-A030 / DLDS-A040 — classify the unverified DeepSeek delta.

The previous DeepSeek round committed 97 files against a taskpack that does not
exist on disk. This script freezes that delta and classifies every file:

* which real task it belongs to (an R5 product task or an authority-pack task),
* why it exists, who produces and consumes it, whether it duplicates something,
  whether it has a schema, tests and rollback,
* one of KEEP / KEEP_WITH_FIX / DUPLICATE / OUT_OF_PACK / UNPROVEN / REVERT.

Classification is data-driven from RULES below (an explicit, reviewable table),
never from memory. Anything not matched by a rule is reported as UNPROVEN, so a
file can never be silently accepted.

Writes:
    reports/current/DEEPSEEK-WORKTREE-INVENTORY.json
    reports/current/DEEPSEEK-WORKTREE-DIFF-SUMMARY.md

Usage:
    python scripts/deepseek_worktree_reconciliation.py            # write
    python scripts/deepseek_worktree_reconciliation.py --check    # verify drift
