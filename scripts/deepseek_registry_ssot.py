"""DLDS-B040 — registry SSOT audit.

One fact, one authoring source. Everything else that carries the fact is a
generated projection, a frozen historical copy, or a defect.

This script walks an explicit, reviewable table of the registry families the
taskpack names (product manifest, adapter registry, capability registry/index,
rights registry, model registry, source lock, evidence index), resolves every
referencing file by grepping the tree, and reports for each family:

* the **authoring source** (edited by a human, never generated),
* the **projections/copies** and who generates them,
* **orphans** (tracked files nobody references) and **unreproducible
  projections** (generated files whose generator is not in the tree),
* the verdict.

Writes reports/current/DEEPSEEK-REGISTRY-SSOT.json.

Usage:
