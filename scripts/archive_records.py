"""Read a governance document that the tree no longer holds at its recorded path.

Records name paths. A document may have been archived (path changed, bytes untouched) and then
removed on owner order (bytes left out of the tree, still reachable from a commit). Both events are
recorded, so a check that needs the document's content can still get it — and can still fail if the
record is missing or the object is gone. Returning nothing is only allowed after both records and
the object database have been consulted.

Used by the DeepSeek chain scripts, which bind a stop-line hash to a document that no longer
exists in the working tree. It is deliberately not a fallback that makes a broken record look fine:
an absent record, a path not listed in it, or an unreadable object all raise.
